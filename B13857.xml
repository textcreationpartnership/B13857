            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So ſecure is <hi>Salomon</hi> of the peoples fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeed, that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not his fathers example in ſetting his ſonne by him, in his owne throne; here was no danger of a riuality to inforce it; no eminency in the ſonne to merit it; It ſufficeth him to know that no bond can bee ſurer than the naturall alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176654:11"/>of ſubiects; I doe not finde that the following Kings ſtood vpon the confirmation of their people; but as thoſe that knew the way to their throne, aſcended thoſe ſteps without aid; As yet the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of <hi>Dauids</hi> houſe was greene, and vnſetled; Iſrael therefore doth not now come to attend <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> but <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> goes vp to meet Iſrael. They come not to his Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but he goes to their <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem: To Shechem were all Iſrael come to make him King;</hi> If loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty drew them together, why not rather to Ieruſalem? there the maieſtie of his fathers Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the magnificence of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:176654:11"/>palace, the verie ſtones in thoſe walles, (beſides the ſtrength of his guard) had pleaded ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their ſubiection; <hi>Shechem</hi> had beene many waies fatall, was euery way incommodious: It is an infinite helpe or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage that ariſes from cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; The very place puts Iſrael in minde of a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; There <hi>Abimelech</hi> had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp his treacherous vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ouer, and againſt his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; There <hi>Goal</hi> againſt <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech;</hi> There was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſold by his brethren: As if the very ſoile had beene ſtained with perfidiouſneſſe.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:176654:12"/>For had hee ſpeedily called vp Iſrael, before <hi>Ieroboam</hi> could haue beene ſent for out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, he had found the way cleere; A little delay may leeſe a great deale of opportunity; what ſhall we ſay of both, but that miſery is led in by infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
                     <p>Had not Iſrael beene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prediſpoſed to a mutinie, they had neuer ſent into Egypt for ſuch a ſpokeſman as <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi> a fugitiue, a traitor to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> long had that crafty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirator lurked in a forraine court; The alliances of Princes are not euer neceſſary bonds of friendſhip: The brother in law of <hi>Salomon</hi> harbours this ſnake
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:176654:12"/>in his boſome, and giues that heat, which is repaid with a ſting to the poſterity of ſo neere an allye: And now <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> death calls him backe to his natiue ſoile: That Iſrael would entertaine a rebell, it was an ill ſigne; worſe yet that they would countenance him; worſt of all that they would imploy him: Nothing doth more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray euill intentions, than the choiſe of vicious Agents: Thoſe that meane well will not hazard either the ſucceſſe, or credit of their actions vpon offenſiue inſtruments; None but the ſluttiſh will wipe their faces with foule clothes. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearts would haue ſaid,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:176654:13"/>as <hi>Dauid</hi> did to God, ſo to his anointed; <hi>Doe not I hate them that hate thee? Yea I hate them with a perfect hatred. Ieroboams</hi> head had beene a fit preſent to haue ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vnto their new King; and now in ſtead thereof they tender themſelues to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> as the head of their faction.</p>
                     <p>Had not <hi>Rehoboam</hi> wanted ſpirits, hee had firſt (after <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> example) done iuſtice to his fathers traytor, and then haue treated of mercy towards his ſubiects; The people ſoone found the weakeneſſe of their new Soueraigne, elſe they durſt not haue ſpoken to him by ſo obnoxious a tongue; <hi>Thy father made our yoke grieuous, make thou

                     <p>How harſhly muſt it needs ſound in the eares of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> that the firſt word hee heares from his people, is a querulous challenge of his fathers go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment; <hi>Thy father made our yoke grieuous;</hi> For ought I ſee the ſuggeſtion was not more
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:176654:14"/>ſpightfull than vniuſt: where was the weight of this yoke, the toyle of theſe ſeruices? Here were none of the turmoyles of warre; no traynings, marchings, encampings, entrenching, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, minings, ſieges, fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; none of that tedious world of worke that attends hoſtility; <hi>Salomon</hi> had not his name for nought; All was calme during that long reigne: And if they had paid deare for their peace, they had no cauſe to complaine of an hard match; The warlike times of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> had exhauſted their bloud, together with their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; what ingratitude was this to cry out of eaſe? Yea but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:176654:15"/>that peace brought forth coſtly and laborious buildings: Gods houſe, and the Kings, the walls of Ieruſalem, <hi>Hazor, Megiddo,</hi> and <hi>Gezer,</hi> the cities of ſtore, the cities of defence, could not riſe without many a ſhoulder: True, but not of any Iſraelites; The remainders of <hi>Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hiuites,</hi> and <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> were put to all the drudgery of theſe great workes; the taskes of Iſrael were eaſie, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous; free from ſeruility, free from painfulneſſe. But the charge was theirs, whoſe-ſoeuer was the labour: The diet of ſo endleſſe a retinue, the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Seraglio, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance for his forty thouſand
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176654:15"/>ſtables, the coſt of his ſacrifices, muſt needs weigh heauy; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if it had layne on none but his owne; But wherefore went <hi>Salomons</hi> Nauy euery three yeeres to <hi>Ophir?</hi> to what vſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix Talents of Gold, that came in one yeare to his Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer? wherefore ſerued the large tributes of forraine nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? How did hee make ſiluer to be in Ieruſalem as ſtones, if the exactions were ſo preſſiue? The multitude is euer prone to picke quarrells with their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours; and whom they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aliue, to cenſure dead; The benefits of ſo quiet and happy a reigne are paſt ouer in ſilence;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176654:16"/>the grieuances are recounted with clamour; Who can hope that merit or greatneſſe can ſhield him from obloquie, when <hi>Salomon</hi> is traduced to his owne loynes?</p>
                     <p>The propoſition of Iſrael puts <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to a deliberation; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part yee for three daies, then come againe to me:</hi> I heare no other word of his that argued wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; Not to giue ſudden reſolutions in caſes of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was a point that might well beſeeme the ſonne of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> I wonder that hee who had ſo much wit as to call for leiſure in his anſwer, ſhould ſhew ſo little wit in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing of that leiſure, in the

As Counſellors, as ancient, as <hi>Salomons,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but ſee the beſt, the ſafeſt courſe for their new So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne: They had learned of their old maſter, that <hi>a ſoft an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer appeaſeth wrath;</hi> wiſely therefore doe they aduiſe him, <hi>If thou wilt be a ſeruant to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this day, and ſpeake good words to them, they will be thy ſeruants for euer;</hi> It was an eaſie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with one mouthfull of breath to purchaſe an euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing homage: with one gentle motion of his tongue, to binde
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176654:17"/>all his peoples hearts to his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance for euer. Yet (as if the motion had beene vnfit) a new Counſell Table is called: well might this people ſay; What will not <hi>Rehoboam</hi> grudge vs, if he thinke much to giue good words for a Kingdome. There is not more wiſdome in taking variety of aduice, where the matter is doubtfull, than folly, when it is plaine: The young heads are conſulted; This very change argues weakenes; Some reaſon might bee pleaded for paſſing from the younger Counſell to the aged; none, for the contrary; Age brings experience; and, it is a ſhame, if with the ancient be not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176654:17"/>Youth is commonly raſh, heady, inſolent, vngouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wedded to will, led by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, a rebell to reaſon, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to paſſion, fitter to execute than to aduiſe: Greene wood is euer ſhrinking and warping, whereas the well-ſeaſoned holds a conſtant firmeneſſe: Many a life, many a ſoule, many a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate hath beene ruined by vndiſciplined Monitors: Such were theſe of <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> whoſe great ſtomach tells them that this conditionating of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, was no other than an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to their new maſter, and ſuggeſts to them, how vnfit it is for Maieſty to brooke ſo ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie a treaty; how requiſite and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:176654:18"/>Princely, to cruſh this preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the egge; As ſcorning therefore to be braued by the baſe Vulgar, they put words of greatneſſe, and terror into their new Prince, <hi>My little finger ſhall be thicker than my fathers loynes; My father made your yoake hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, I will adde to your yoake; My father hath chaſtiſed you with whips, I will chaſtiſe you with Scorpions.</hi> The very words haue ſtings; Now muſt Iſrael needs thinke; How cruell will this mans hands be, when he thus drawes bloud with his tongue? Men are not wont to ſpeake out their worſt; who can endure the hopes of him that promiſeth tyranny? There can
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:176654:18"/>bee no good vſe of an indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite profeſſion of rigor and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity; Feare is an vnſafe guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of any ſtate, much leſſe of an vnſetled. Which was yet worſe, not the ſinnes of Iſrael were threatned, nor their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but their perſons; neither had they deſired a remiſſion of iuſtice, but of exactions; and now, they heare of nothing but burdens, and ſcourges, and Scorpions.</p>
                     <p>Here was a Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple well met; I doe not finde them ſenſible of ought, ſaue their owne profit; They doe not ſay; Religion was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſhutting vp of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers daies; Idolatry found the

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176654:26"/>the magnificence of the royall Palace of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſhall admoniſh them of their natiue allegeance; whiles (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſolicitation of their brethren) the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites ſhall preach to them the neceſſity of their due obedience, and the abomination of their ſacrifices in their wilfull diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; whiles they ſhall (by their preſence) put themſelues vpon the mercy, or iuſtice of their lawfull, and forſaken Prince; Either therefore I muſt diuert them from Ieruſalem, or elſe I cannot liue and reigne. It is no diuerting them by a direct reſtraint; ſuch prohibition would both endanger their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:176654:26"/>diſtaſte, and whet their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to more eagerneſſe: I may change religion, I may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit it; ſo the people haue a God, it ſufficeth them; they ſhall haue ſo much formality as may content them; their zeale is not ſo ſharpe, but they can be well pleaſed with eaſe; I will proffer them both a more compendious, and more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worſhip; Ieruſalem ſhall be ſupplied within mine owne borders; naturally men loue to ſee the obiects of their deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I will therefore feed their eies with two golden repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their God, nearer home; and what can bee more proper than thoſe, which

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:176654:28"/>but know the expreſſe charge of God againſt the making of Images, againſt the erecting of any riuall altars, to that of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, yet now that hee ſees both theſe may auaile much to the aduancing of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious proiects, he ſets vp thoſe Images, thoſe Altars; Wicked men care not to make bold with God in caſes of their owne commodity; If the lawes of their Maker lie in the way of their profit, or promotion, they either ſpurne them out, or tread vpon them at pleaſure: Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mindes will know no God but honour. Iſrael ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Egypt &amp; brought home a golden calfe; <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iournes

                     <p>No ſooner are <hi>Ieroboams</hi> calues vp, than Iſrael is downe on their knees: their worſhip followes immediatly vpon the erection; How eaſily is the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable vulgar carried into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer religion of authority?

                     <p>It is not the mettall that makes his Gods, but the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the ſacrifices: What ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice could there bee without Prieſts? No religion could euer want ſacred maſters of Diuine

                     <p>It is ſtrange that hee who thought the dregs of the vulgar good enough for that Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, would grace thoſe Gods, by acting their Prieſt himſelfe; and yet behold where the new King of Iſrael ſtands before his new Altar, with a Scepter in one hand, and a Cenſer in the other, ready to ſacrifice to his new Gods; when the man of God comes from <hi>Iuda,</hi> with a meſſage of iudgement; Oh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate condition of Iſrael, that was ſo far gone with impiety,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:176654:31"/>that it yeelded not one faithfull monitor to <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> The time was, that the erecting of but a new altar (for memory, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument) on the other ſide <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> bred a challenge to the Tribes of <hi>Reuben, Gad,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes;</hi> and had coſt much Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiſh bloud, if the quarrelled Tribes had not giuen a ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pious ſatisfaction; and now, loe how the ſtronger ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of degenerated Iſrael can digeſt new Altars, new Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, new Gods; What a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt a Church and Kingdome newly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from affliction, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon the lees of a miſ-uſed peace?</p>

                     <p>It was the Altar, not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet thus threatens; Yet not the ſtones are ſtricken, but the founder; in both their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions: So deare are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of our owne braine to vs, as if they were incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues; There is no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition whereof we are ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as that of religion.</p>
                     <p>That the royall Altar ſhould
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176654:33"/>be thus polluted by dead mens bones, and the bloud of the Prieſts, was not more vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, than that all this ſhould bee done by a childe of the houſe of <hi>Dauid;</hi> for <hi>Ieroboam</hi> well ſaw that the throne and the altar muſt ſtand, or fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; that a ſonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> could not haue ſuch power ouer the Altar, without an vtter ſubuerſion of the gouernment, of the ſucceſſion; therefore is he thus galled with this commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory prediction; The rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious people who had ſaid, <hi>What portion haue we in Dauid,</hi> heare now, that <hi>Dauid</hi> will perforce haue a portion in them: and might well ſee, what beaſts
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:176654:33"/>they had made themſelues, in worſhipping the image of a beaſt; and ſacrificing to ſuch a God, as could not preſerue his owne Altar from violation, and ruine.</p>
                     <p>All this while I doe not ſee this zealous Prophet laying his hand to the demolition of this Idolatrous Altar; or threatning a knife to the Author of this deprauation of religion; Only his tongue ſmites both; not with foule, but ſharpe words; of menace, not of reproach; It was for <hi>Ioſias</hi> a King, to ſhed the bloud of thoſe ſacrificers, to deface thoſe Altars: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are for the tongue, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the hand; Prophets muſt

                     <p>Future things are preſent to the Eternall; It was ſome two hundred and ſixty yeares, ere this prophecy ſhould bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; yet the man of God ſpeakes of it as now in acting; What are ſome Centuries of yeares to the Ancient of daies? How ſlow, and yet how ſure is the pace of Gods reuenge? It is not in the power of time to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Gods determinations; There is no leſſe iuſtice, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity in a delaied puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>What a perfect Record there is of all names in the roll of Heauen; before they be, after they are paſt? what euer ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

He that knows what names we ſhall haue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we or the world haue a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth not oft reueale this peece of his knowledge to his creature; here he doth; naming the man that ſhould bee two hundred yeeres after; for more aſſurance of the euent; that Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el may ſay, this man ſpeakes from a God who knowes what ſhall be: There cannot bee a more ſure euidence of a true Godhead, than the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe things, whoſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:176654:35"/>cauſes haue yet no hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But becauſe the proofe of this prediction was not more certaine, than remote; a preſent demonſtration ſhall conuince the future; <hi>The altar ſhall rend in peeces, the aſhes ſhall be ſcattered;</hi> How amazedly muſt the ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Iſraelites needs looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this miracle; and why doe they not thinke with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; whiles theſe ſtones rend, why are our hearts whole? Of what an ouer-ruling power is the God whom we haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that can thus teare the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of his corriualls? How ſhall we ſtand before his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, when the very ſtones breake at the word of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176654:35"/>Perhaps, ſome beholders were thus affected; but <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> whom it moſt concerned, in ſtead of bowing his knees for humiliation, ſtretcheth forth his hand for reuenge, and cries, Lay hold on him: Reſolute wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is impatient of a reproofe, and in ſtead of yeelding to the voice of God, rebelleth: Iuſt and diſcreet reprehenſion doth not more reforme ſome ſinners than exaſperare others.</p>
                     <p>How eaſie is it for God to coole the courage of proud <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam?</hi> the hand which his rage ſtretches out, dries vp, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pulled backe againe: and now ſtands the King of Iſrael like ſome anticke ſtatue, in a poſture of impotent indeuour; ſo diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176654:36"/>to the hurt of the Prophet, that hee cannot command that peece of himſelfe; What are the great Potentates of the world, in the powerfull hand of the Almighty? Tyrans cannot bee ſo harmefull as they are mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrongeſt heart may bee brought downe with affliction; Now the ſtout ſtomach of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> is fallen to an humble depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; <hi>Intreat now the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be reſtored me againe.</hi> It muſt needs be a great ſtreight that could driue a proud heart to beg mercy, where he bent his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; ſo doth <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it no ſcorne to be beholden to an enemy; In extremities, the

                     <p>It well becomes the Prophets of God to bee mercifull; I doe not ſee this Seer to ſtand vpon termes of exprobration, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conteſtations with <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> to ſay, Thine intentions to mee were cruell; Had thine hand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, I ſhould haue ſued to thee in vaine; Continue euer a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the fearefull iuſtice of thy Maker, whom thou haſt prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by thine Idolatry, whom thou wouldſt haue ſmitten in my perſecution; but hee meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſues for <hi>Ieroboams</hi> releaſe; and (that God might abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifie both his power and mercy) is heard and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

                     <p>I know not what to thinke of an old Prophet that dwels in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> within the ayre of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Idoll, within the noyſe of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; that liues where the man of God dares not eat; that permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſonnes to bee preſent at that Idolatrous ſeruice; If hee were a Prophet of God, what did he now in <hi>Bethel?</hi> why did hee winke at the ſinne of <hi>Ieroboam?</hi> what needed a Seer to come out of <hi>Iuda,</hi> for the reproofe of that ſinne, which was acted vnder his noſe? why did he lye? why did his family partake with Idolaters? If he were not a Prophet of God; how had he true viſions, how had he true meſſages from God; why did he ſecond the menacing word of that Prophet, whom he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:176654:41"/>ſeduced? why did he deſire that his owne bones might be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his Sepulcher? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he was a Prophet of God, but corrupt, reſtie, vicious; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy doth not alwaies preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſanctification; many a one hath had viſions from God, who ſhall neuer inioy the viſion of God. A very <hi>Balaam</hi> in his exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, hath ſo cleere a reuelation of the Meſſiah to come, as ſcarce euer any of the holieſt Prophets; yea, his very Aſſe hath both her mouth miraculouſly opened, and her eies; to ſee and notifie that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, which was hid from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; Yea, Satan himſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receiues notice from God of his future actions; which elſe that euill Spirit could neither
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:176654:41"/>foretell, nor foreſee. Theſe kinds of graces are both rare, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; rare, in that they are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome giuen to any; common, in that they are indifferently giuen to the euill, and to the good; A little holineſſe is worth much il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination.</p>
                     <p>Whether out of enuy, to heare that ſaid by the Seer of <hi>Iuda,</hi> which he either knew not or ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; to heare that done by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which he could not haue effected, and could not chooſe but admire; or whether out of deſire to make triall of the fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſo powerfull a Meſſenger, the old Prophet haſtens to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, to recall that man of God. who had ſo defied his <hi>Bethel;</hi> vvhom he findes ſitting faint and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:176654:42"/>weary vnder an Oake, in the way; taking the benefit of that ſhade which he hated to receiue from thoſe contagious groues that hee had left behind him; His habit eaſily bewrayed him, to a man of his owne trade: neither doth his tongue ſpare to profeſſe himſelfe. The old Prophet of <hi>Bethel</hi> inuites him to a returne, to a repaſt: and is anſwered with the ſame words, wherewith <hi>Ieroboams</hi> offer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; The man of God varies not a ſyllable from his meſſage: It concernes vs to take good heed of our charge, when we goe on Gods errand. A deniall doth but inuite the importunate; what hee cannot doe by intreatie, the old man tries to doe by perſwaſion; <hi>I am a Prophet alſo as thou art, and an

Satan may affright vs as a fiend, but he ſeduces vs as an Angell of light.</p>
                     <p>Who would haue look't for a Lier vnder hoarie haires, and an holy mantle? who would not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:176654:43"/>haue truſted that grauity, when there was no colour of any gaine in the vntruth? Nothing is ſo apt to deceiue as the faireſt ſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the ſweeteſt words. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre if wee beleeue not the ſpeech for the perſon, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the ſpeech; Well might this man of God thinke, An aged man, a Prophet, an old Prophet, will not (ſure) bely God vnto a Prophet; No man will forge a lie, but for an aduantage; What can this man gaine by this match, but the entertainement of an vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable gueſt; Perhaps though God would not allow me to feaſt with <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> yet, pitying my faintneſſe, he may allow me to eat with a Prophet; Perhaps now that I haue approued my fidelity
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:176654:43"/>in refuſing the bread of <hi>Bethel,</hi> God thinkes good to ſend mee a gratious releaſe of that ſtrict charge; Why ſhould I thinke that Gods reuelations are not as free to others, as to me? and if this Prophet haue receiued a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from an Angell of God, how ſhall I not diſobey God, if I doe not follow him?</p>
                     <p>Vpon this ground hee returnes with his deceitfull hoſt, and when the meat was now in his mouth, receiues the true meſſage of death, from the ſame lips that brought him the falſe meſſage of his inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>for as much as thou haſt diſobeyed the mouth of the Lord, and haſt not kept the commandement of the Lord thy God, but cameſt backe and haſt eaten
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:176654:44"/>bread, and drunke water in the place forbidden thee, thy carkaſſe ſhall not come to the Sepulcher of thy fathers.</hi> Oh wofull Prophet, when hee lookes on his hoſt he ſees his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, whiles he is feeding of his body, hee heares of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe; at the table, he heares of his denied Sepulcher; and all this, for eating and drinking where he was forbidden by God, though bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as from God; The violation of the leaſt charge of a God is mortall; No pretences can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the tranſgreſſion of a diuine command: A word from God is pleaded on both ſides; The one was receiued immediatly from God, the other related mediatly by man; One the Prophet was ſure of, the other was queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:176654:44"/>A ſure word of God may not be left for an vncertaine; An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge of the Almighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not of any checke: His will is but one, as himſelfe is; and therefore is out of the danger of contradiction.</p>
                     <p>Me thinks I ſee the man of God change countenance at this ſharp ſauce of his pleaſing morſels; his face before hand is died with the paleneſſe of death; me thinkes I heare him vrging many vnkinde expoſtulations with his iniurious hoſt; who yet diſmiſſes him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prouided for the eaſe of his iourney, than he found him. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, this officiouſneſſe was out of deſire to make ſome amends for his late ſeducement. It is a poore recompence when he hath
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:176654:45"/>betrayed the life, and wronged the ſoule, to caſt ſome curteſies vpon the body.</p>
                     <p>This old Bethelite that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken paines to come and fetch the man of God into ſinne, will not now goe backe with him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his departure; Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee was afraid to bee inwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the iudgement, which hee ſaw hanged ouer that obnoxious head; Thus the miſchieuous guides of wickednes leaue a man, when they haue led him to his bane; as familiar Deuils forſake their witches, when they haue brought them once into fetters.</p>
                     <p>The man of God returnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, carefull (no doubt) and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue for his offence, when a lion out of the wood meets him, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:176654:45"/>him, kills him; Oh the iuſt and ſeuere iudgements of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who hath brought this fierce beaſt out of his wild ranges, into the high way, to bee the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of his offending ſeruant: Doubtleſſe this Prophet was a man of great holineſſe, of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fidelity, elſe he durſt not haue beene Gods Herald to carry a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of defiance to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> King of Iſrael, in the midſt of all his royall magnificence; yet now, for varying from but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods command (though vpon the ſuggeſtion of a diuine warrant) he is giuen for a prey to the Lion: Our intereſt in God is ſo far from excuſing our ſin, that it aggrauates it; Of all others the ſin of a Prophet ſhall not paſſe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged.</p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:176654:46"/>
                     <p>The very wild beaſts are led by a prouidence; Their wiſe and powerfull Creator knows how to ſerue himſelfe of them: The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons guard one Prophet, kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion receiued from their Maker; What ſinner can hope to eſcape vnpuniſhed, when euery creature of God is ready to be an auenger of euill? The beaſts of the field were made to ſerue vs, we to ſerue our Creator; When wee forſake our homage to him that made vs, it is no maruell if the beaſts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their duty to vs, and deale with vs not as Maſters, but as rebels; When an holy man buyes ſo dearely ſuch a ſleight frailty, of a credulous miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, what ſhall become of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:176654:46"/>our hainous and preſumptuous ſinnes?</p>
                     <p>I cannot thinke but this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet died in the fauour of God, tho by the teeth of the Lion; His life was forfeited for example, his ſoule was ſafe; Yea his very car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe was left though torne, yet faire after thoſe deadly graſpes; as if God had ſaid; I will onely take thy breath from thee, as the penalty of thy diſobedience, a Lion ſhall doe that which an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie, or feuer might doe; I owe thee no further reuenge than may be ſatisfied with thy bloud.</p>
                     <p>Violent euents doe not alwaies argue the anger of God; Euen death it ſelfe is, to his ſeruants, a fatherly caſtigation.</p>
                     <p>But oh the vnſearchable waies
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176654:47"/>of the Almighty! The man of God ſinnes, and dies ſpeedily; the lying Prophet that ſeduced him ſuruiues; Yea wicked <hi>Ieroboam</hi> enioyes his Idolatry, and treads vpon the graue of his reprouer: There is neither fauour in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of ſtripes, nor diſpleaſure in the haſte; Rather whom God loues, he chaſtiſes, as ſharply, ſo ſpeedily; whiles the reſt proſper to condemnation: Euen the rod of a louing father may draw bloud; How much happier is it for vs that we die now to liue for euer; than that we liue a while, to die euer?</p>
                     <p>Had this Lion ſet vpon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for hunger, why did he not deuoure as well as kill him? Why did hee not rather kill the beaſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:176654:47"/>than the man? ſince we know the nature of the Lion ſuch, that he is not wont to aſſaile man, ſaue in the extreme want of other prey. Certainely the ſame power that imployed thoſe fangs, reſtrained them; that the world might ſee, it was not appetite that prouoked the beaſt to this violence, but the ouer-ruling command of God; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo, ô Lord, thy powerful hand is ouer that roaring Lion, that goes about continually, ſeeking whom he may deuoure: thine hand with-holds him, that though he may ſhed the blood of thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, yet hee cannot hurt their ſoules; and whiles he doth thoſe things which thou permitteſt, and ordereſt to thy iuſt ends, yet he cannot doe leſſer things, which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:176654:48"/>he deſireth, and thou permitteſt not.</p>
                     <p>The fierce beaſt ſtands by the carkaſſe, as, to auow his owne act, and to tell who ſent him; ſo to preſerue that body, which he hath ſlaine; Oh wonderfull work of God, the Executioner is turn'd Guardian; and (as the Officer of the higheſt) commands all other creatures to ſtand aloofe from his charge: and commands the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Aſſe, that brought this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thither, not to ſtirre thence, but ſtand ready preſt, to recarrie it to the Sepulcher: And now, when he hath ſufficiently witneſſed to all paſſengers, that this act was not done vpon his owne hunger, but vpon the quarrell of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, he deliuers vp his charge to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:176654:48"/>that old Prophet; who was no leſſe guiltie of this blood than himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>This old Seducer hath ſo much Truth, as both to giue a right Commentarie vpon Gods inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this act, for the terrour of the diſobedient, and to giue his voyce to the certaintie of that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture iudgement, which his late gueſt had threatned to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> (ſometimes it pleaſed the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to expreſſe and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelfe euen by the tongues of faultie Inſtruments.) Withall, he hath ſo much faith and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as to fetch that carkaſſe from the Lyon; ſo much pietie and compaſſion, as to weepe for the man of God, to interre him in his owne Sepulcher; ſo much loue, as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176654:49"/>to wiſh himſelfe ioyned in death, to that bodie, which he had haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto death; It is hard to finde a man abſolutely wicked; Some grace will bewray it ſelfe in the moſt forſaken breaſts.</p>
                     <p>It is a cruell courteſie to kill a man, and then to help him to his graue; to betray a man with our breath, and then to bedew him with our teares; The Prophet had needed no ſuch friend, if hee had not met with ſuch an enemy; <hi>The mercies of the wicked are cruell.</hi>

                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:176654:50"/>no grace; He is enough troubled with his ſonnes diſgrace, no whit bettered; I would haue heard him ſay; God followes me with his afflictions; it is for mine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie; what other meaſure can I expect from his Iuſtice? Whiles mine Idols ſtand, how can I look that my houſe ſhould proſper? I will turne from my wickedneſſe, O God turne thou from thy wrath; Theſe thoughts were too good for that obdured heart; His ſonne is ſicke, hee is ſorrowfull; but (as an amazed man ſeekes to goe forth at the wrong doore) his diſtraction ſends him to a falſe help: He thinks not of God, he thinkes of his Prophet: Hee thinkes of the Prophet that had foretold him he ſhould be a King;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:176654:51"/>he thinkes not of the God of that Prophet who made him a King; It is the propertie of a carnall heart to confine both his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and his hopes to the means, neglecting the Authour of good.

                     <p>Extremitie drawes <hi>Ieroboams</hi> thoughts to the Prophet; whom elſe he had not cared to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

Wicked breaſts are falſe to themſelues; neither truſting to their owne choice, nor making choice of that, which they may dare to truſt.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:176654:52"/>ſinnes, and had rather bee ſelfe-condemned, than wiſe and penitent: As for that old Seer, it is like <hi>Ieroboam</hi> knew his skill, but doubted of his fincerity; that man was too much his neighbour to be good; <hi>Ahijahs</hi> truth had beene tried in a caſe of his owne; Hee whoſe word was found iuſt in the prediction of his kingdome, was well worthy of credit in the newes of his ſonne; Experience is a great encouragement of our truſt; It is a good matter to bee faithfull; this loadſtone of our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity ſhall draw to vs euen hearts of iron, and hold them to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance: As contrarily deceit doth both argue, and make a bankrupt; who can truſt where he is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed?

                     <p>Yet I doe not ſee that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſends to the Prophet for his aid, but for his intelligence, Curioſity is guilty of this meſſage, and not deuotion; he calls not for the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not for the benediction of that holy man, but for meere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the euent. He well ſaw what the prayers of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet could doe; That which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his hand, might it not haue cured his ſonne? Yet he that ſaid to a man of God, <hi>Intreat the face of the Lord thy God, that hee may reſtore my hand;</hi> ſaies not now, in

Yet, thus fond is our reſtleſſe curioſity, that it ſeekes eaſe in the drawing on of torment; He is worthy of ſorrow that will not ſtay till it comes to him, but goes to fetch it.</p>
                     <p>Whom doth <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſend on this meſſage, but his wife, and how, but diſguiſed? Why her, and why thus? Neither durſt he truſt this errand with another, nor with her in her owne forme: It
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:176654:53"/>was a ſeceet that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſends to a Prophet of God; none might know it but his owne boſome, and ſhe that lay in it; if this had beene noiſed in Iſrael, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had beene dangerous; Who would not haue ſaid, The King is glad to leaue his counterfeit dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſeeke to the true; Why ſhould we adhere to them whom he forſakes? As the meſſage muſt not be knowne to the people; ſo ſhee that beares it muſt not bee knowne to the Prophet, her name, her habit muſt bee changed; ſhee muſt put off her robes, and put on a ruſſet coat; ſhe muſt put off the Queene, and put on the peaſant; in ſtead of her Scepter, ſhe muſt take vp a basket, and goe a masked pilgrimage to <hi>Shiloh;</hi> Oh the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:176654:54"/>fondnes of vaine men that thinke to iuggle with the Almighty, and to hide their counſells from that all-ſeeing ere! If this change of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit were neceſſary at <hi>Bethel,</hi> yet what needs it at <hi>Shiloh;</hi> though ſhe would hide her face from her ſubiects, yet why would ſhe not pull off her muffler, and ſhew her ſelfe to the Prophet? Certainly, what policy began, guiltineſſe muſt continue; Well might ſhee thinke, there can be no good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer expected of the wife of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam;</hi> my preſence will doe no leſſe, than ſolicit a reproofe; No Prophet can ſpeake well to the conſort of a founder of Idolatry, I may perhaps heare good as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though as my ſelfe I can looke for nothing, but tidings of

                     </p>
                     <p>But oh the groſſe folly mixt with the craft of wickedneſſe! could <hi>Ieroboam</hi> thinke that the Prophet could know the euent of his ſonnes diſeaſe, and did hee thinke that hee could not know the diſguiſe of his Wife? the one was preſent, the other future; this face was but wrapt vp in a clout, that euent was wrapt vp in the counſell of God; Yet this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique head preſumes that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

As if God had lent him the keies of heauen to ſhut it vp, and open it at pleaſure; he can ſay, <hi>There ſhall be neither dew, nor raine, theſe yeares, but according to my word;</hi> Oh God, how farre it hath pleaſed thee to communicate thy ſelfe to a weake man?

                     <p>The brooke Cherith cannot laſt alwaies; that ſtreame ſhall not for <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſake be exempted from the vniuerſall exſiccation; Yea the Prophet himſelfe feeles the ſmart of this drought, which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; It is no vnvſuall thing with God to ſuffer his owne deare

                     <p>There were other birds beſides Rauens, other widowes beſides this <hi>Sareptan;</hi> none but the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, none but the <hi>Sareptan</hi> ſhall nouriſh <hi>Elijah.</hi> Gods choice is not led in the ſtring of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; his holy will is the guide, and

                     <p>The Prophet followes the call of his God; the ſame hand that brought him to the gate of <hi>Sarep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> led alſo this poore widdow out of her doores; ſhe ſhall then goe to ſeeke her ſticks, when ſhe ſhall be found of <hi>Elijah;</hi> ſhe thought of her hearth, ſhe thought not of a Prophet; when the man of God cals to her, <hi>Fetch me a little water (I pray thee) in a veſſell, that I may drinke.</hi> It was no eaſie ſuit in ſo droughtie a ſeaſon; and yet, at the firſt ſight, the Prophet dares ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it with a greater; <hi>Bring me a morſell of bread in thine hand;</hi> That long drought had made euery

                     </p>
                     <p>If ſhe knew not the man, how did ſhe know his God? and if ſhe knew not the God of <hi>Elijah,</hi> how did ſhe ſweare by him? Certainly though ſhee were without the bounds of Iſrael, yet ſhe was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

It was high time for the Prophet to viſit the <hi>Sareptan;</hi> pooreſoule, ſhe was now making her laſt meale; after one meane morſell ſhe was yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſelfe ouer to death. How oportunely hath God prouided ſuccours to our diſtreſſes?

                     <p>But oh, what a tryall is this of the faith of a weake Proſelyte, if ſhe were ſo much; <hi>Feare not, goe doe as thou haſt ſaid; but make mee thereof a little cake firſt; and bring it to me, and after make for thee, and thy ſonne; For, thus ſaith the God of Iſrael; The barrell of meale ſhall not waſte, nor the cruſe of oyle faile till the day that God ſend raine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth;</hi> She muſt goe ſpend vpon a ſtranger part of that little ſhe hath, in hope of more which ſhe hath not, which ſhe may haue; ſhee muſt part with her preſent food, which ſhe ſaw, in truſt of future which ſhe could not ſee; ſhe muſt rob her ſenſe in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of her beleefe; and ſhorten her life in being, vpon the hope of a protraction of it, in promiſe;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:176654:80"/>ſhe muſt beleeue God will mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly increaſe what ſhe hath yeelded to conſume; ſhee muſt firſt feed the ſtranger with her laſt victuals, and then after her ſelfe, and her ſonne; Some ſharpe dame would haue ſhaken vp the Prophet, and haue ſent him away with an angry repulſe: Bold Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite, there is no reaſon in this requeſt, wer't thou a friend, or a brother, with what face couldſt thou require to pull my laſt bit out of my mouth? Had I ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of prouiſion, thou might'ſt hope for this effect of my charity; now, that I haue but one morſell for my ſelfe, and my ſonne, this is an iniurious importunitie; what can induce thee to think thy life (an vnknowne traueller)
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:176654:81"/>ſhould be more deare to me, than my ſonnes, than my owne? How vnciuill is this motion that I ſhould firſt make prouiſion for thee, in this dying extremitie? It had beene too much to haue beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my laſt ſcraps; Thou telleſt me the meale ſhall not waſte, nor the oyle faile; how ſhall I beleeue thee? Let me ſee that done, before thou eateſt; In vaine ſhould I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge thee when the remainder of my poore ſtore is conſumed; If thou canſt ſo eaſily multiply vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, how is it that thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt? Doe that before-hand, which thou promiſeſt ſhall be afterwards performed, there will be no need of my litle. But this good <hi>Sareptan</hi> was wrought by God not to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt a Prophet; ſhe will do what

How hard precepts doth God lay where he intends bountie; Had not God ment her preſeruation, he had ſuffered her to eat her laſt cake alone, without any interpellation: now the mercy of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie purpoſing as well this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fauour to her, as to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, requires of her this taske, which fleſh and blood would haue thought vnreaſonable.

                     <p>Happy was it for this widow, that ſhe did not ſhut her hand to the man of God; that ſhe was no niggard of her laſt handfull; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer corne or oliue did ſo increaſe in growing, as here in conſuming; This barrell, this cruſe of hers had no bottome; the barrell of meale waſted not, the cruſe of oyle fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not; Behold, not getting, not ſauing, is the way to abundance, but giuing. The mercy of God crownes our benificence with the bleſſing of ſtore; who can feare want by a mercifull liberalitie, when he ſees the <hi>Sareptan</hi> had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:176654:82"/>if ſhe had not giuen, and by giuing, abounded? With what thankfull deuotion muſt this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man euery day needs looke vpon her barrell, and cruſe, wherein ſhe ſaw the mercy of God renewed to her continually? Doubtleſſe her ſoule was no leſſe fed by faith, than her body with this ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall prouiſion. How welcome a gueſt muſt <hi>Elijah</hi> needs bee to this widow, that gaue her life and her ſonnes to her, for his board? yea, that in that wofull famine gaue her and her ſon their board for his houſe-roome.</p>
                     <p>The dearth thus ouercome, the mother lookes hopefully vpon her onely ſonne, promiſing her ſelfe much ioy in his life and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie; when an inexpected ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:176654:83"/>ſurprizeth him, and doth that which the famine but threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; When can we hold our ſelues ſecure from euils? no ſooner is one of theſe Sergeants compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withall, than we are arreſted by another.</p>
                     <p>How ready we are to miſtake the grounds of our afflictions; and to caſt them vpon falſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; The paſſionate mother can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde whither to impute the death of her ſonne, but to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Elijah;</hi> to whom ſhee comes diſtracted with perplexitie, not without an vnkinde chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of him from whom ſhe had receiued both that life ſhee had loſt, and that ſhe had; <hi>What haue I to doe with thee, O thou man of God, Art thou come to me to call my
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:176654:83"/>ſinne to remembrance, and to ſlay my ſonne?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As if her ſonne could not haue died if <hi>Elijah</hi> had not beene her gueſt; when as her ſonne had died, but for him; why ſhould ſhe thinke that the Prophet had ſaued him from the famine, to kill him with ſickneſſe? As if God had not beene free in his actions; and muſt needs ſtrike by the ſame hands, by which hee preſerued; She had the grace to know that her affliction was for her ſinne; yet was ſo vnwiſe, to imagine the arerages of her iniquities had not beene called for, if <hi>Elijah</hi> had not beene the remembrancer; Hee, who had appeaſed God towards her, is ſuſpected to haue incenſed him; This wrongfull miſ-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:176654:84"/>was enough to moue any patience; <hi>Elijah</hi> was of an hot ſpirit; yet his holineſſe kept him from fury; This challenge rather increaſed the zeale of his prayer, than ſtirred his choller to the offendent: He takes the dead childe out of his mothers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and laies him vpon his owne bed, and cries vnto the Lord; <hi>Oh Lord my God, haſt thou brought euill alſo vpon the Widow with whom I ſoiourne, by ſlaying her ſonne?</hi> In ſtead of chiding the Sareptan, out of the feruency of his ſoule, he humbly expoſtulates with his God: His only remedy is in his prayer; that which ſhut heauen for raine, muſt open it for life. Euery word inforceth; Firſt he pleads his intereſt in God;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:176654:84"/>
                        <hi>Oh Lord my God;</hi> then the quality of the patient; <hi>a Widow,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, both moſt diſtreſſed with the loſſe, and moſt peculiar to the charge of the Almighty. Then, his intereſt, as in God, ſo in this pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; <hi>with whom I ſoiourne;</hi> as if the ſtroke were giuen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, through her ſides; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the quality of the puniſhment, <hi>By ſlaying her ſonne,</hi> the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of her life; and in all theſe, implying the ſcandall, that muſt needs ariſe from this euent, where euer it ſhould bee noiſed, to the name of his God, to his owne; when it ſhould be ſaid; Loe how <hi>Elijahs</hi> entertainement is rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Surely the Prophet is either impotent, or vnthankfull.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth his tongue moue
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:176654:85"/>thus only; Thrice doth he ſtretch himſelfe vpon the dead body; as if he could wiſh to infuſe of his owne life into the childe; and ſo often calls to his God for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of that ſoule: What can <hi>Elijah</hi> aske to be denied? The Lord heard the voice of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the ſoule of the child came into him againe, and he reuiued: What miracle is impoſſible to faithfull prayers? There cannot be more difference betwixt <hi>Elijahs</hi> deuotion, and ours, than betwixt ſupernaturall and ordinary acts; If he therefore obtained miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fauours by his prayers, doe wee doubt of thoſe which are within the ſphere of nature, and vſe? What could we want, if we did not ſlacke to plye heauen
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:176654:85"/>with our prayers?</p>
                     <p>Certainly <hi>Elijah</hi> had not beene premoniſhed of this ſudden ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and death of the child; He who knew the remote affaires of the world, might not know what God would doe within his owne roofe; The greateſt Prophet muſt content himſelfe with ſo much of Gods counſell, as he will pleaſe to reueale; and he will ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the greater ſecrets, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the leſſe, to make good both his owne liberty, and mans humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. So much more vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as the ſtroke was, ſo much more welcome is the cure; How ioyfully doth the man of God take the reuiued child into his armes, and preſent him to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? How doth his heart leape
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:176654:86"/>within him, at this proofe of Gods fauour to him, mercy to the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, power to the child?</p>
                     <p>What life and ioy did now ſhow it ſelfe in the face of that amazed mother, when ſhee ſaw againe the eyes of her ſonne fixed vpon hers; when ſhe felt his fleſh warme, his motions vitall? Now ſhee can ſay to <hi>Elijah; By this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth;</hi> Did ſhee not till now know this? Had ſhee not ſaid before, <hi>What haue I to doe with thee, ô thou man of God?</hi> Were not her cruſe, and her barrell ſufficient proofes of his diuine commiſſion? Doubtleſſe what her meale and oyle had aſſured her of, the death of her ſonne made her to doubt;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:176654:86"/>and now the reuiuing did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcertaine.

                     <p>Oh degenerated eſtate of Iſrael; any thing was now lawfull there, ſauing piety; It is well if Gods Prophets can finde an hole to hide their heads in; They muſt needs be hard driuen when fifty of them are faine to croud toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one caue; There they had both ſhade and repaſt: Good <hi>Obadiah</hi> hazards his owne life to preſerue theirs; and ſpends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in that extreme dearth, vpon their neceſſary diet; Bread and water was more now, than other whiles, wine, and delicates; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we wonder more at the

                        <hi>Elijah</hi> heares of the progreſſe, and offers himſelfe to the view of them both; Here was wiſdome in this courage; Firſt, he preſents himſelfe to <hi>Obadiah,</hi> ere he will be ſeene of <hi>Ahab;</hi> that <hi>Ahab</hi> might vpon the report of ſo diſcreet an informer, digeſt the expectation of his meeting; Then he takes the oportunitie of <hi>Ahabs</hi> preſence,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Elijah</hi> receiues the reuerence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes a charge; <hi>Goe tell thy Lord, Behold Elijah is here: Obadiah</hi> finds
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:176654:91"/>this lode too heauy; neither is he more ſtriken with the boldneſſe, than with the vnkindneſſe of this command; boldneſſe in reſpect of <hi>Elijah;</hi> vnkindneſſe in reſpect of himſelfe: For, thus he thinks; If <hi>Elijah</hi> doe come to <hi>Ahab,</hi> he dies; If he doe not come, I die; If it be knowne that I met him, and brought him not, it is death; If I ſay that he will come voluntarily, and God ſhall alter his intentions, it is death: How vnhappy a man am I, that muſt be either <hi>Elijahs</hi> executioner, or my owne: Were <hi>Ahabs</hi> diſpleaſure but ſmoking, I might hope to quench it, but now that the flame of it hath broken forth to the notice, to the ſearch of all the kingdomes, and nations round about, it may conſume me,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:176654:91"/>I cannot extinguiſh it; This meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage were for an enemie of <hi>Elijah;</hi> for a client of <hi>Baal;</hi> As for me, I haue well approued my true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to God, my loue to his Prophets: What haue I done, that I ſhould be ſingled out either to kill <hi>Elijah,</hi> or to be killed for him? Many an hard plunge muſt that man needs be driuen to, who would hold his conſcience toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſeruice, and fauour of a Tyrant: It is an happy thing to ſerue a iuſt maſter; there is no danger, no ſtraine in ſuch obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>But, when the Prophet bindes his reſolution with an oath, and cleares the heart of <hi>Obadiah</hi> from all feares, from all ſuſpicions, the good man dares be the meſſenger
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:176654:92"/>of that, which hee ſaw was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in heauen: Doubtleſſe <hi>Ahab</hi> ſtartled to heare of <hi>Elijah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to meet him; as one that did not more hate, than feare the Prophet. Well might hee thinke; thus long, thus farre haue I ſought <hi>Elijah, Elijah</hi> would not come to ſeeke mee, but vnder a ſure gard, and with ſome ſtrange com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; His courſe mantle hath the aduantage of my robe and Scepter; If I can command a peece of the earth, I ſee hee can command heauen: The edge of his reuenge is taken off with a doubtfull expectation of the iſſue: and now when <hi>Elijah</hi> offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the eies of <hi>Ahab;</hi> He who durſt not ſtrike, yet durſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Prophet, <hi>Art thou he that

Ieroboams</hi> hand was ſtill in <hi>Ahabs</hi> thoughts; hee holds it not ſo ſafe to ſmite, as to expoſtulate: Hee, that was the head of Iſrael, ſpeakes out that which was in the heart of all his people, that <hi>Elijah</hi> was the cauſe of all their ſorrow: Alas what hath the righteous Prophet done? He taxed their ſinne, he foretold the iudgement; hee deſerued it not, he inflicted it not; yet he ſmarts, and they are guilty: As if ſome fond people ſhould accuſe the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald or the Trumpet as the cauſe of their warre; or as if ſome ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant peaſant, when he ſees his fowls bathing in his pond, ſhould cry out of them, as the cauſes of foule weather.</p>

                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:176654:93"/>he ſtands alone a mids all the traine of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and dares not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repell this charge, but retort it; <hi>I haue not troubled Iſrael, but thou and thy fathers houſe, in that yee haue forſaken the commandements of the Lord, and thou haſt followed Baalim.</hi> No earthly glory can daunt him who hath the cleere and heartning viſions of God; This holy Seer diſcernes the true cauſe of our ſufferings, to be our ſinnes; Fooliſh men are plagued for their offences; and it is no ſmall part of their plague that they ſee it not; The onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſturber of men, families, cities, kingdomes, worlds, is ſin; There is no ſuch traitor to any ſtate, as the wilfully wicked; The quieteſt and moſt plauſible offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:176654:93"/>is ſecretly ſeditious, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth quarrels in heauen.</p>
                     <p>The true meſſengers of God cary authority euen where they are maligned; <hi>Elijah</hi> doth at once reproue the King, and require of him the improuement of his power, in gathering all Iſrael to <hi>Carmel,</hi> in fetching thither all the Prophets of <hi>Baal. Baal</hi> was rich in Iſrael, whiles God was poore; Whiles God hath but one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Prophets, hid cloſely in <hi>Obadiahs</hi> caues, <hi>Baal</hi> hath eight hundred and fifty; foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty diſperſed ouer the villages and townes of Iſrael, foure hundred at the Court; Gods Prophets are glad of bread and water, whiles the foure hundred Trencher-Prophets of <hi>Iezebel</hi> feed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:176654:94"/>on her dainties: They lurke in caues whiles theſe Lord it in the pleaſanteſt groues. Outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is a falſe note of truth: All theſe with all Iſrael, doth <hi>Elijah</hi> require <hi>Ahab</hi> to ſummon vnto <hi>Carmel.</hi> It is in the power of Kings to command the aſſembly of the Prophets; the Prophet ſues to the Prince for the indiction of this Synode: They are iniurious to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty who arrogate this power to none but ſpirituall hands. How is it that <hi>Ahab</hi> is as ready to performe this charge, as <hi>Elijah</hi> to moue it? I dare anſwer for his heart, that it was not drawne with loue: Was it out of the ſenſe of one iudgement, and feare of another? he ſmarted with the dearth and drought, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:176654:94"/>well thinkes <hi>Elijah</hi> would not be ſo round with him, for nothing: Was it out of an expectation of ſome miraculous exploit which the Prophet would doe in the ſight of all Iſrael? Or, was it out of the ouer-ruling power of the Almighty; <hi>The heart of kings is in the hand of God, and he turnes it which way ſoeuer he pleaſeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Iſrael is met together, <hi>Elijah</hi> rates them, not ſo much for their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, as for their vnſetlednes, and irreſolution: One Iſraelite ſerues God, another <hi>Baal;</hi> yea the ſame Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite perhaps ſerues both God &amp; <hi>Baal. How long halt ye betweene two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him;</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more odious to God than a prophane neutrality in maine
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:176654:95"/>oppoſitions of religion; To goe vpright in a wrong way, is a leſſe eye-ſore to God, than to halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt right and wrong; The Spirit wiſheth that the Laodicean were either hot or cold; either tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per would be better borne, than neither, than both; In reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able differences nothing is more ſafe than indifferency both of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and opinion; but in caſes of ſo neceſſary hoſtility, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God, and <hi>Baal,</hi> he that is on neither ſide is the deadlieſt enemy to both; Leſſe hatefull are they to God that ſerue him not at all, than they that ſerue him with a riuall.</p>
                     <p>Whether out of guiltineſſe, or feare, or vncertainty, Iſrael is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; yet whiles their mouth was ſhut, their eares were open: It was
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:176654:95"/>a faire motion of <hi>Elijah; I am only remaining a Prophet of the Lord, Baals Prophets are foure hundred and fifty; Let them chooſe one bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, let me chooſe another; Their deuotion ſhall bee combined, mine ſingle; The God that conſumes the ſacrifice by fire from heauen, let him bee God;</hi> Iſrael cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it; the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> cannot refuſe it; they had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the aduantage, in their number, in the fauor of King, and people. Oh ſtrange diſputation, wherein the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which muſt be vſed is fire; the place whence it muſt bee fetcht, heauen; the mood and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, deuotion; the concluſion, death to the ouercomne.</p>
                     <p>Had not <hi>Elijah,</hi> by diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:176654:96"/>beene aſſured of the euent, he durſt not haue put religion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch an hazard; That God commanded him this triall, who meant confuſion to the authors of Idolatry, victory to the truth; His power ſhall be approued both by fire and by water; firſt by fire, then by water; There was no leſſe terror in the fire, than mercy in the raine; It was fit they ſhould bee firſt humbled by his terrors, that they might be made capable of his mercy; and by both, might be won to repentance. Thus ſtill the feares of the law make way for the influences of grace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe thoſe ſweet and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dewes deſcend vpon the ſoule, till way be mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:176654:110"/>of feare, and infirmity: To be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and vnchangeably good, is proper onely to the glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in heauen: Thus the wiſe and holy God will haue his power perfited in our weakeneſſe; It is in vaine for vs, whiles wee carry this fleſh about vs, to hope for ſo exact health, as not to bee caſt downe ſometimes with fits of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall diſtemper. It is no new thing for holy men to wiſh for death; Who can either maruell at, or blame the deſire of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? For the weary traueller to long for reſt, the priſoner for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the baniſhed for home, it is ſo naturall, that the contrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were monſtrous: The benefit of the change is a iuſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to our appetition; but to call
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:176654:111"/>for death, out of a ſatiety of Life, out of an impatience of ſuffering, is a weakeneſſe vnbeſeeming a Saint: It is not enough, O <hi>Elijah;</hi> God hath more work yet for thee: thy God hath more honored thee, than thy fathers, and thou ſhalt liue to honor him.</p>
                     <p>Toile and ſorrow haue lulled the Prophet aſleep, vnder his Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tree; that wholeſome ſhade was well choſen, for his repoſe: whiles death was called for, the cozen of death comes vnbidden: The Angell of God waits on him in that hard lodging; no wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is too ſolitary for the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thoſe bleſſed ſpirits; As he is guarded, ſo is hee awaked by that meſſenger of God; and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp from his reſt, to his repaſt;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:176654:111"/>whiles hee ſlept, his breakfaſt is made ready for him, by thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall hands; <hi>There was a cake ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the coales, and a cruſe of water at his head:</hi> Oh the neuer-ceaſing care and prouidence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, not to be barred by any place, by any condition; when meanes are wanting to vs, when we are wanting to our ſelues, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God, euen then doth he follow vs with his mercy, and caſt fauors vpon vs, beyond, againſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: What variety of purueiance doth hee make for his ſeruant? One while the rauens, then the Sareptan, now the Angell ſhall be his Cator; none of them without a miracle. Thoſe other prouided for him waking, this ſleeping; O God, the eye of thy prouidence is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:176654:112"/>not dimmer, the hand of thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is not ſhorter; onely teach thou vs to ſerue thee, to truſt thee.</p>
                     <p>Needes muſt the Prophet eat, and drinke, and ſleepe with much comfort, whiles he ſaw that he had ſuch a guardian, attendant, puruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and now the ſecond time is he raiſed, by that happy touch, to his meale, &amp; his way: <hi>Ariſe and eat, becauſe the iourney is too great for thee.</hi> What needed he to trauell further, ſith that diuine power could as well protect him in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as in <hi>Horeb?</hi> What needed he to eat, ſince hee that meant to ſuſtaine him forty daies with one meale, might as well haue ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him without it? God is a moſt free Agent, neither will bee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:176654:112"/>tied to the termes of humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities: It is enough that hee knowes, and approues the reaſons of his owne choice, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: Once in forty dayes and nights ſhall <hi>Elijah</hi> eat, to teach vs what God can doe with little meanes: and but once, to teach vs what he can doe without meanes: Once ſhall the Prophet eat, <hi>Man liues by bread;</hi> and but once, <hi>Man liues not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceeds out of the mouth of God; Moſes, Elijah,</hi> our Sauiour faſted each of them forty daies, and fortie nights: the three great faſters met gloriouſly in <hi>Tabor:</hi> I finde not where God euer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured any man for feaſting; It is abſtinence, not fulneſſe, that makes a man capable of heauenly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:176654:113"/>viſions, of diuine glory.</p>
                     <p>The iourney was not of it ſelfe ſo long; the Prophet tooke thoſe wayes, thoſe houres which his heart gaue him: In the very ſame mount where <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt ſaw God, ſhall <hi>Elijah</hi> ſee him: one and the ſame caue (as is very probable) was the receptacle to both; It could not bee but a great confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to <hi>Elijah,</hi> to renue the ſight of thoſe ſenſible monuments of Gods fauour, and protection, to his faithfull predeceſſor. <hi>Moſes</hi> came to ſee God in the buſh of <hi>Horeb;</hi> God came to finde <hi>Elijah</hi> in the caue of <hi>Horeb:</hi> What doeſt thou here, <hi>Elijah?</hi> The place was directed by a prouidence, not by a command: Hee is hid ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from <hi>Iezebel;</hi> hee cannot be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:176654:113"/>hid from the all-ſeeing eye of God. <hi>Whither ſhall I goe from thy Spirit?</hi> or <hi>Whither ſhall I flie from thy preſence? If I aſcend vp into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, thou art there; if I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there; If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the vttermoſt parts of the Sea, euen there ſhall thine hand finde mee, and thy right hand ſhall hold me:</hi> Twice hath God propounded the ſame queſtion to <hi>Elijah:</hi> Once in the heart, once in the mouth of the caue: Twice doth the Prophet anſwer, in the ſame words: Had the firſt anſwer ſatisfied, the queſtion had not beene re-demanded. Now, that ſullen anſwer which <hi>Elijah</hi> gaue in the darkneſſe of the caue is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged into the Light, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an awfull preface. The Lord
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:176654:114"/>firſt paſſeth by him with the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtrations of his power. A great and ſtrong wind rent the mountaines, and brake the rockes in peeces; That tearing blaſt was from God, God was not in it: So was hee in it as in his other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary workes; not ſo in it, as by it to impart himſelfe to <hi>Elijah:</hi> it was the vſhier, not the carriage of God; After the wind came an Earthquake, more fearfull than it: That did but moue the ayre, this the earth; that beat vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences of earth, this ſhook it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Center; After the earth-quake came a fire more fearfull than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The other affected the eare, the feeling; but this lets in horror into the Soule, by the eye, the quickeſt, and moſt apprehenſiue
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:176654:114"/>of the ſenſes. <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhall ſee Gods mighty power in the earth, ayre, fire, before hee heare him in the ſoft voice; All theſe are but boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous harbingers of a meeke, and ſtill word; In that God was; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in that gentle and milde breath there was omnipotency; there was but powerfulneſſe in thoſe fierce repreſentations; There is not alwayes the greateſt efficacy where is the greateſt noiſe: God loues to make way for himſelfe by terror, but hee conuaies himſelfe to vs, in ſweetneſſe: It is happy for vs if after the guſts and flaſhes of the Law, wee haue heard the ſoft voice of Euangelicall mercy.</p>
                     <p>In this very mount, with the ſame horror had God deliuered his Law to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael:</hi> It is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:176654:115"/>no maruell if <hi>Elijah</hi> wrap his face in his mantle: His obedience drawes him forth to the mouth of the caue, his feare ſtill hides his head: Had there not beene much courage in the Prophets faith, hee had not ſtood out theſe affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fore-runners of the diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, though with his face coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: The very Angels do no leſſe, before that all-glorious Maieſtie than vaile themſelues with their wings: Farre bee it from vs once to thinke of that infinite, and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Deitie, without an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble awfulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Feare changes not the tenor of <hi>Elijahs</hi> anſwer: Hee hath not left one word behind him in the caue: <hi>I haue beene very iealous for the Lord God of hosts, becauſe the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:176654:115"/>haue forſaken thy Couenant, throwne downe thine Altars, and ſlaine thy Prophets with the ſword, and I, euen I onely, am left, and they ſeeke my life to take it away.</hi> I heare not a direct anſwer from the Prophet to the demand of God; then he had ſaid, I run away from the threats of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel,</hi> and here I hide my head from her malicious purſuit; His guiltineſſe would not let him ſpeake out all: He had rather ſay, <hi>I haue beene iealous for the Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> than, I was fearefull of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel:</hi> We are all willing to make the beſt of our owne caſe: but what he wants of his owne accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, hee ſpends vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Neither doth hee more bemone himſelfe, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime againſt them, as Apoſtates
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:176654:116"/>from Gods Couenant, Violaters of his Altars, murtherers of his Prophets: It muſt needs bee a deſperate condition of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that driues <hi>Elijah</hi> to indite them before the throne of God: That tongue of his was vſed to plead for them, to ſue for their pardon, it could not be but a forceable wickednes, that makes it their accuſer. Thoſe Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to reformation: The fire and raine from heauen at the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Elijah</hi> had wonne them to a ſcorne of <hi>Baal;</hi> onely the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>Iezebel</hi> turned the ſtream, and now they are re-ſetled in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, and perſecute him for an enemy, whom they almoſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a benefactor; otherwiſe, <hi>Elijah</hi> had not complained of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:176654:116"/>what they had beene: Who would thinke it? <hi>Iezebel</hi> can doe more than <hi>Elijah;</hi> No miracle is ſo preualent with the vulgar, as the ſway of authority, whether to good, or euill.</p>
                     <p>Thou art deceiued, O <hi>Elijah;</hi> Thou art not left alone; neither is all <hi>Iſrael</hi> tainted; God hath chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Prophets in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though thou ſee them not; Thoſe cleere eyes of the Seer diſcerne not the ſecret ſtore of God, they look't not into <hi>Obadiahs</hi> caues, they look't not into the cloſets of the religious <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> hee that ſees the heart, can ſay, <hi>I haue left me ſeuen thouſand in Iſrael,</hi> all the knees which haue not bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Baal,</hi> and euery mouth which hath not kiſſed him: According
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:176654:117"/>to the faſhion of the wealthy, God pleaſeth himſelfe in hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; it is enough that his owne eies behold his riches: Neuer did he, neuer wil he leaue himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed with holy clients, in the midſt of the fouleſt deprauations of his Church: The ſight of his faithful ones hath ſometimes been loſt, neuer the being: Doe your worſt, O yee Gates of Hell, God will haue his owne; He that could haue more, will haue ſome: that foundation is ſure, <hi>God knoweth who are his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was a true cordiall for <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſolitarineſſe, that hee had ſeuen thouſand inuiſible abettors; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it a ſmall comfort to our weakneſſe, to haue companions in good: for the wickedneſſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:176654:117"/>God hath another receit; the oyle of royall, and propheticall vnction; <hi>Elijah</hi> muſt anoint <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> king of <hi>Syria, Iehu</hi> King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; Eliſha</hi> for his ſucceſſor; All theſe ſhall reuenge the quarrels of God, and him; one ſhall begin, the other ſhall proſecute, the third ſhall perfect the vengeance vpon <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Prophet ſhall auenge the wrongs done to a Prophet: <hi>Eliſha</hi> is found, not in his ſtudy, but, in the field; not with a booke in his hand, but a plough; His father <hi>Shaphat</hi> was a rich farmer in <hi>Abel-Meholah,</hi> himſelfe was a good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; traind vp, not in the ſchooles of the Prophets, but, in the thrifty trade of tillage: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, this was the man, whom
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:176654:118"/>God will picke out of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a Prophet; God ſeeth not as man ſeeth: Neither doth hee chooſe men becauſe they are fit, but therefore fits them, becauſe hee hath choſen them; his call is aboue all earthly inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>I heare not of ought that <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaid: Onely hee caſts his cloake vpon <hi>Eliſha</hi> in the paſſage; That mantle, that act was vocall: To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this ſigne, Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct teacheth the amazed ſonne of <hi>Shaphat</hi> that he was deſigned to an higher worke, to breake vp the fallow grounds of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by his propheticall function; He findes a ſtrange vertue in that robe; and (as if his heart were changed with that habit) forgets his teme, and runs after <hi>Elijah;</hi> and ſues for the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:176654:118"/>leaue of a farewell to his Parents, ere he had any but a dumbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to follow; The ſecret call of God offers an inward force to the heart, and inſenſibly drawes vs beyond the power of our reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Grace is no enemie to good nature; well may the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to our earthly parents ſtand with our duties to our Father in heauen. I doe not ſee <hi>Eliſha</hi> wring his hands and deplore his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he ſhall leaue the world, and follow a Prophet, but for the ioy of that change, hee makes a feaſt: thoſe oxen, thoſe vtenſils of husbandry whereon his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer labours had beene beſtowed, ſhall now bee gladly deuoted to the celebration of that happy day, wherein hee is honoured with ſo
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:176654:119"/>bleſſed an imployment; If with deſire, if with cheerefulnes we do not enter into the works of our heauenly Maſter, they are not like to proſper in our hands: Hee is not worthy of this ſpirituall ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who holds not the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God his higheſt, his richeſt prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:176654:136"/>will, a ſight of his owne bloud; and now diſguiſed herewith, and with aſhes vpon his face, he way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes the King of Iſrael, and ſadly complaines of himſelfe in a reall parable, for diſmiſſing a <hi>Syrian</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner deliuered to his hands, vpon no leſſe charge than his life; and ſoone receiues ſentence of death, from his owne mouth; Well was that wound beſtowed that ſtruck <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſoule through the fleſh of the Prophet; The diſguiſe is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; The King ſees not a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but a Seer; and now finds that he hath vnawares paſſed ſentence vpon himſelfe. There needs no other doome than from the lips of the offender: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Becauſe thou haſt let goe out of thy hand, a man whom I appointed to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:176654:136"/>vtter deſtruction, therefore thy life ſhall goe for his life, and thy people for his people:</hi> Had not <hi>Ahab</hi> knowne the will of God concerning <hi>Benhadad,</hi> that had been mercy to an enemy, which was now crueltie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to Iſrael: His cares had heard of the blaſphemies of that wicked tongue: His eies had ſeene God goe before him, in the example of that reuenge, No Prince can ſtrike ſo deepe into his ſtate, as in not ſtriking; In priuate fauour there may be publike vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſſe.</p>

                     <p>Wickedneſſe neuer ſpake out of a throne, and complained of the defect of inſtruments; <hi>Naboth</hi> was (it ſeemes) ſtrictly conſcionable, his fellow Citizens looſe, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; they are glad to haue gotten ſuch an opportunitie of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch: No clauſe of <hi>Ahabs</hi> letter is not obſerued; A faſt is warned, the Citie is aſſembled, <hi>Naboth</hi> is conuented, accuſed, confronted, ſentenced, ſtoned.

All this was the viſor of ſorrow, not the face; or if the face, not the heart; or if the ſorrow of the heart, yet not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: A ſorrow for the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not a repentance for the ſin: The very deuils howle to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; Griefe is not euer a ſigne of grace; <hi>Ahab</hi> rends his clothes, he did not rend his heart; he puts on ſack-cloth, not amendment; he lies in ſack-cloth, but he lies in his Idolatry; he walkes ſoftly, he walkes not ſincerely; Worldly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cauſeth death; Happy is that

                     <p>Yet Iſrael and Iuda were now peeced in friendſhip; <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> the good King of Iuda had made affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with <hi>Ahab</hi> the Idolatrous King of Iſrael: and, beſides a perſonall viſitation, ioynes his forces with his new Kinſman, againſt an old confederate; Iuda had calld in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria againſt Iſrael; and now Iſrael calls in Iuda againſt Syria: Thus

                     <p>Bold <hi>Micaiah,</hi> (as no whit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with the vniuſt checks of greatneſſe) doubles his predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and by a ſecond viſion par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularizeth the meanes of this dangerous errour; Whiles the two Kings ſate maieſtically in their thrones, he tels them of a more glorious Throne, than theirs, whereon he ſaw the King of Gods ſitting; Whiles they were compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſome hundreds of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and thouſands of Subiects, and Souldiers, he tels them of all the hoſt of heauen, attending that other Throne; Whiles they were deliberating of a warre, hee tels them of the God of heauen iuſtly
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:176654:157"/>decreeing the iudgement of a deadly deception to <hi>Ahab;</hi> This decree of the higheſt is not more plainly reuealed, than expreſſed parabolically: The wiſe and holy God is repreſented, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, conſulting of that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, which he intended to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked King of Iſrael; That increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and infinite wiſdome, needs not the aduice of any finite, and created powers, to direct him, needs not the aſſent, and aid of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpirit for his execution; much leſſe of an euill one; yet here an euill ſpirit is brought in (by way of viſion mixt with parable) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the ſeruice of his lie, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, imploied, ſucceſſefull; Theſe figures are not void of truth; The action and euent is reduced to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:176654:157"/>the decree is ſhadowed out by the reſemblance of humane proceedings; All euill motions, and counſels are originally from that malignant Spirit; That euill ſpirit could haue no power ouer men, but by the permiſſion, by the decree of the Almightie; That Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, as he is no Author of ſin, ſo he ordinates all euill to good; It is good that is iuſt; it is iuſt that one ſinne ſhould be puniſhed by another: Satan is herein no other than the executioner of that God, who is as farre from infuſing euill, as from not reuenging it; Now <hi>Ahab</hi> ſees the ground of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded conſent of his rabble of Prophets; one euill ſpirit hath no leſſe deceiued them, than they their maſter; he is one, therefore
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:176654:158"/>he agrees with himſelfe; he is euill, therefore both he, and they agree in deceit.</p>
                     <p>Oh the noble and vndaunted ſpirit of <hi>Michaiah;</hi> neither the Thrones of the Kings, nor the number of the Prophets could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate one word of his true (though diſpleaſing) meſſage; The King of Iſrael ſhall heare, that he is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by liers, they by a deuill; Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> cannot but wonder at ſo vnequall a contention; to ſee one ſilly Prophet affronting foure hundred; with whom leſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould carrie it, behold <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi> more bold, more zealous; If <hi>Michaiah</hi> haue giuen him (with his fellowes) the lie, he giues <hi>Michaiah</hi> the fiſt: Before theſe two great Guardians of peace, and iuſtice,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:176654:158"/>ſwaggering <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſmites <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiah</hi> on the face; and with the blow expoſtulates; <hi>Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me, to ſpeake vnto thee?</hi> For a Prophet to ſmite a Prophet, in the face of two Kings, was intolerably inſolent; the act was much vnbeſeeming the perſon, more the preſence; Prophets may reproue, they may not ſtrike; It was enough for <hi>Ahab</hi> to puniſh with the hand; no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon was for <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> but his tongue; neither could this rude preſumption haue beene well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if malice had not made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie inſenſible of this vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Ahab</hi> was well content to ſee that hated mouth beaten by any hand: It is no new condition of Gods faithfull meſſengers to ſmart
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:176654:159"/>for ſaying true. Falſhood doth not more bewray it ſelfe in any thing, than in blowes; Truth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, whiles error perſecutes: None are more ready to boaſt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, than thoſe that haue the leaſt; As in veſſels, the full are ſilent.</p>
                     <p>Innocent <hi>Michaiah,</hi> neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, nor complaines; It would haue well beſeemed the religious King of Iudah, to haue ſpoken in the cauſe of the dumbe, to haue checked inſolent <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> Hee is content to giue way to this tide of peremptorie, and generall oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The helpleſſe Prophet ſtands alone, yet laies about him with his tongue, <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt ſee in that day, when thou ſhalt goe into an inner chamber, to hide thy ſelfe;</hi> Now the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:176654:159"/>proud Baalite ſhewed himſelfe too much; ere long he ſhall bee glad to lurke vnſeene; his hornes of iron cannot beare off this danger.

                     </p>
                     <p>An hard doome of Truth; The Iayle for his lodging; courſe bread
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:176654:160"/>and water for his food, ſhall but reſerue <hi>Micaiah</hi> for a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. The returne of <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhall be the bane of the Prophet; Was not this he that aduiſed <hi>Benhadad,</hi> not to boaſt in putting on his Armour, as in the vngirding it; and doth he now promiſe himſelfe peace and victorie, before hee buckle it on? No warning wil diſſwade the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; So aſſured doth <hi>Ahab</hi> make himſelfe of ſucceſſe, that he threats ere he goe, what he will doe when he returnes in peace: How iuſtly doth God deride the miſ-recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of proud and fooliſh men; If <hi>Ahab</hi> had had no other ſinnes, his very confidence ſhall defeat him; yet the Prophet cannot bee ouercome in his reſolution; hee knowes his grounds cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:176654:160"/>him; and dare therefore caſt the credit of his function vpon this iſſue; <hi>If thou returne at all in peace, the Lord hath not ſpoken by me;</hi> And hee ſaid, <hi>Hearken, O people, euery one of you;</hi> Let him neuer be called a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that dare not truſt his God; This was no aduenture therefore of reputation, or life; ſince hee knew whom he beleeued, the euent was no leſſe ſure, than if it had beene paſt; He is no God that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to himſelfe; Hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not performe? What hold haue wee for our ſoules, but his eternall word? The being of God is not more ſure, than his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, than his ſentences of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Well may we appeale the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the world in both; If there be not plagues for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:176654:161"/>If there bee not rewards for the righteous, God hath not ſpoken by vs.</p>
                     <p>Not <hi>Ahab</hi> onely, but good <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> is carried with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; Their forces are ioyned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ramoth;</hi> The King of Iſrael doth not ſo truſt his Prophets, that hee dares truſt himſelfe in his owne clothes; Thus ſhall he elude <hi>Michaiahs</hi> threat; Iwis the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, the Syrian ſhafts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde him out in this vnſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted diſguiſe; How fondly doe vaine men imagine to ſhift off the iuſt reuenges of the Almightie?</p>
                     <p>The King of Syria giues charge to his Captaines to fight againſt none, but the King of Iſrael; Thus doth the vnthankfull Infidell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay the mercy of his late victor;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:176654:161"/>Ill was that Snake ſaued, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites the fauour of his life, with a ſting; Thus ſtill the greateſt are the faireſt marke to enuious eyes. By how much more eminent any man is in the Iſrael of God, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, and more dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies muſt he expect; Both earth and hell conſpire in their oppoſition to the worthieſt. Thoſe who are aduanced aboue others, haue ſo much more need of the guard, both of their owne vigilancy, and others prayers. <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> had like to haue paid deare for his loue; Hee is purſued, for him, in whoſe amity he offended; His cries deliuer him; his cries, not to his purſuers, but to his God; whoſe mercy takes not aduantage of our infirmitie, but reſcues vs from thoſe euils, which

The Prophet hides not himſelfe from the purſuit of <hi>Ahaziah;</hi> rather he ſits where hee may be moſt conſpicuous, on the top of an hill; this band knowes well where to finde him; and climbes vp, in the ſight of <hi>Elijah,</hi> for his arreſt; The ſteepneſſe of the aſcent (when they drew neere to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:176654:169"/>the higheſt reach) yeelded a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience both of reſpiration and parle; thence doth the Captaine imperiouſly call downe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Who would not tremble at the dreadfull anſwer of <hi>Elijah, If I be a man of God, then let fire come downe from heauen and conſume thee, and thy fiftie;</hi> What ſhall we ſay? That a Prophet is reuengefull, that Souldiers ſuffer whiles a Prophet ſtrikes; that a Princes command is anſwered with imprecation, words with fire, that an vnarmed Seer ſhould kill one and fiftie at a blow? There are few tracks of <hi>Elijah</hi> that are ordinary, and fit for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon feet; His actions are more for wonder, than for precedent: Not in his owne defence would the Prophet haue beene the death
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:176654:169"/>of ſo many, if God had not by a peculiar inſtinct made him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of this iuſt vengeance; The diuine iuſtice findes it meer to doe this for the terror of Iſrael, that he might teach them, what it was to contemne, to perſecute a Prophet; that they might learne to feare him whom they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, and confeſſe that heauen was ſenſible of their inſolencies, and impieties; If not as viſibly, yet as certainly doth God puniſh the violations of his ordinances, the affronts offered to his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſtill and euer: Not euer with the ſame ſpeed; ſometimes, the puniſhment ouertakes the act; ſometimes dogs it afarre off, and ſeizeth vpon the offender, when his crime is forgotten. Here, no
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:176654:170"/>ſooner is the word out of <hi>Elijahs</hi> mouth, than the fire is out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Oh the wonderfull power of a Prophet! There ſits <hi>Elijah</hi> in his courſe mantle, on the top of the hill, and commands the heauens, and they obey him, <hi>Let fire fall downe from heauen;</hi> Hee needs no more but ſay what he would haue done; The fire fals downe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vpon the ſacrifice in <hi>Carmel,</hi> ſo now vpon the Souldiers of <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah;</hi> What is man in the hands of his Maker? One flaſh of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath conſumed theſe one and fiftie; And if all the hoſts of Iſrael, yea of the world, had beene in their roomes, there had needed no other force; What madneſſe is it for him whoſe breath is in his noſthrils, to contend with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie?
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:176654:170"/>The time was, when two zealous Diſciples would faine haue imitated this fiery reuenge of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and were repelled with a checke; The very place puts them in minde of the iudgement: Not farre from Samaria was this done by <hi>Elijah,</hi> and wiſht to bee done by the Diſciples: So churliſh a reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Sauiour ſeemed no leſſe hainous, than the endeuour of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending a Prophet; <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heauen, and conſume them, as Elias did.</hi> The world yeelded but one <hi>Elias;</hi> That which was zeale in him, might he fury in another; the leaſt variation of circumſtance may make an example dangerous; preſently therefore doe they heare, <hi>Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are;</hi> It is
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:176654:171"/>the calling that varies the ſpirit; <hi>Elijah</hi> was Gods miniſter for the execution of ſo ſeuere a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were but the Seruants of their owne impotent anger; there was fire in their breaſts, which God neuer kindled; farre was it from the Sauiour of men, to ſecond their earthly fire, with his heauenly; He came indeed to ſend fire vpon earth; but to warme, not to burne; and if to burne, not the perſons of men, but their corruptions; How much more ſafe is it for vs to follow the meeke Prophet of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than that feruent Prophet of the Old: Let the matter of our prayers be the ſweet dewes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not the fires of vengeance.</p>
                     <p>Would not any man haue

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:176654:172"/>the ſame tongue, the ſame breath; God hath fire enough for all the troupes of <hi>Ahaziah:</hi> Immediatly, doth a ſudden flame breake out of heauen, and conſume this forward Leader, and his bold followers: It is a iuſt preſage and deſert of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, not to bee warned: Worthily are they made examples, that will not take them.</p>
                     <p>What Marble, or Flint is harder than a wicked heart? As if <hi>Ahazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> would deſpightfully ſpit in the face of heauen, and wreſtle a fall with the Almightie, he will needs yet againe ſet a third Captaine, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo deſperate an imployment; How hot a ſeruice muſt this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander needs thinke himſelfe put vpon? Who can but pittie his ſtraits? There is death before him,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:176654:172"/>death behinde him: If he goe not, the Kings wrath is the meſſenger of death; if he goe, the Prophets tongue is the executioner of death; Many an hard taske will follow the ſeruice of a Prince wedded to his paſſion, diuorced from God; Vnwillingly, doubtleſſe, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doth this Captaine climbe vp the hill, to ſcale that impregnable Fort; but now, when he comes neere to the aſſault, the batterie that he laies to it, is his prayers; his ſureſt fight is vpon his knees; <hi>He went vp, and came, and fell vpon his knees, before Elijah, and beſought him, and ſaid vnto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of theſe fiftie thy ſeruants, be pretious in thy ſight;</hi> hee confeſſes the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that befell his Predeceſſors;
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:176654:173"/>the monuments of their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were in his eye, and the terror of it, in his heart; of an enemy therefore he is become a ſuppliant, and ſues not ſo much for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets yeeldance, as for his owne life; This was the way to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Prophet of God, to the God of that Prophet, euen humble ſupplications; Wee muſt deprecate that euill, which wee would auoid; if wee would force bleſſings, we muſt intreat them; There is nothing to be gotten from God by ſtrong hand, any thing by ſuit. The life of the Captaine is preſerued; <hi>Elijah</hi> is by the Angell commanded to goe downe with him, ſpeedily, feareleſly.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:176654:173"/>I ſhall put my ſelfe into the hands of rude Souldiers, and by them, into the hands of an enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged King; if hee did not eagerly thirſt after my bloud, he had neuer ſought it, with ſo much loſſe; But, ſo ſoone as he had a charge from the Angell, hee walkes downe reſolutely, and (as it were) dares the dangers of ſo great an hoſtilitie: Hee knew that the ſame God, who had fought for him, vpon the hill, would not leaue him in the Valley; hee knew that the Angell which bade him goe, was guard enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a world of enemies.

                     <p>The Prophet lookes boldly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Court; which doubtleſſe was not a little diſ-affected to him; and comes confidently into the bed-chamber of <hi>Ahaziah;</hi> and ſticks not to ſpeake ouer the ſame words to his head, which hee had ſent him not long ſince by his firſt meſſengers; Not one ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will the Prophet abate of his errand; It is not for an Herald of heauen to be out of countenance; or to mince ought of the moſt kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling meſſages of his God.</p>
                     <p>Whether the inexpected confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence both of the man, and of the ſpeech amazed the ſicke King of Iſrael, or whether the feare of ſome preſent iudgement (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee might ſuſpect <hi>Elijah</hi> to come armed vpon any act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:176654:175"/>&amp; fetcht them vpon the knees of their humble ſubmiſſion: It is good truſting God with the euents of his owne commands; who can at pleaſure either auert euils, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them to good.</p>
                     <p>According to the word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Ahaziah</hi> dies; not two whole yeeres doth he ſit in the throne of Iſrael; which he now muſt yeeld (in the want of children) to his brother.

And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the aſſurance of our owne bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, to help others to the ſame heauen? But, O God, who can but wonder at the courſe of thy wiſe and powerfull adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Euen in the midſt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and Idolatries of Iſrael haſt thou reſerued to thy ſelfe whole ſocieties of holy Prophets; and out of thoſe ſinfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted Tribes, haſt raiſed the two great miracles of Prophets, <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> in an immediat ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Iudah</hi> it ſelfe vnder a religious <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> yeelded not ſo eminent, and cleerely illuminated ſpirits: The mercy of our prouident God will neither bee confined, nor exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; neither confined to the places
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:176654:177"/>of publike profeſſion, nor exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the depraued Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his owne people; where he hath loued, he cannot eaſily bee eſtranged: Rather, where ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, his grace aboundeth much more; and raiſeth ſo much ſtronger helps, as hee ſees the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers greater.</p>
                     <p>Happy was <hi>Eliſha</hi> in the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſo gracious a maſter, and more happy that he knows it: Faine would <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhake him off at <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;</hi> if not there, at <hi>Bethel;</hi> if not yet there, at <hi>Iericho.</hi> A priuate meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage (on which <hi>Elijah</hi> muſt goe alone) is pretended, from the Lord; Whether ſhall wee ſay the Prophet did this for the triall of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant affection of his carefull and diligent ſeruant, or, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:176654:177"/>from <hi>Elijah</hi> that his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was reuealed to <hi>Eliſha:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he that knew of his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception into heauen, did not know what witneſſes would be allowed to that miraculous act: and now his humble modeſtie affected a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vn-noted paſſage; Euen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> knew ſomething that was hid from his maſter, now vpon the threſhold of heauen: No meere creature was euer made of the whole counſell of the Higheſt: Some things haue bin diſcloſed to babes and nouices, that haue beene cloſed vp to the moſt wiſe and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious: In naturall ſpeculations the greater wit, and deeper iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill caries it; but in the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God, the fauour of his choice ſwaies all; not the power
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:176654:178"/>of our apprehenſion: The maſter may both command and intreat his ſeruants ſtay, in vaine; <hi>Eliſha</hi> muſt be pardoned this holy and zealous diſobedience, <hi>As the Lord liueth, and as thy ſoule liueth, I will not leaue thee;</hi> His maſter may be withdrawne from him, hee will not be withdrawne from his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. He knew that the bleſſing was at the parting; and if hee had dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently attended all his life, and now ſlacked in the laſt act, he had loſt the reward of his ſeruice. The euening praiſes the day; and the chiefe grace of the theater is in the laſt Scene; <hi>Bee faithfull to the death, and I will giue thee a Crowne of life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhould be tranſlated, and what day he ſhould be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God would haue no ſecret;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:176654:178"/>The ſonnes of the Prophets at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> at <hi>Iericho,</hi> both know it, and aske <hi>Eliſha</hi> if hee knew it not; <hi>Knowest thou that the Lord will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy master from thy head this day?</hi> and he anſwered, <hi>Yea, I know it, hold yee your peace.</hi> How familiarly doe theſe Prophets inter-know one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? How kindly doe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their viſions? Seldome euer was any knowledge giuen to keepe, but to impart; The grace of this rich Iewell is loſt in conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The remouall of an <hi>Elijah</hi> is ſo important a buſineſſe, that it is not fit to be done without noiſe; Many ſhall haue their ſhare in his loſſe; he muſt be miſſed on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; it was meet therefore that the world ſhould know his rapture ſhould be diuine and glorious. I doe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:176654:179"/>not finde where the day of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall death is notified to ſo many; by how much more wonder there was in this Aſſumption, by ſo much more ſhall it be fore-reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. It is enough for ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents to be knowne in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent: ſupernaturall things haue need of premonition, that mens hearts may bee both prepared for their receit, and confirmed in their certaintie. Thrice was <hi>Eliſha</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, thrice hath he denied, to ſtay behinde his now-departing maſter; on whom both his eyes and his thoughts are ſo fixed, that he cannot giue allowance ſo much as to the interpellation of a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his fellow-Prophets: Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore are this wonderfull paire comne to the laſt ſtage of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:176654:179"/>their ſeparation, the bankes of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</hi> Thoſe that were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee attendants of the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet will not be debarred from being ſpectators of ſo maruellous an iſſue; Fiftie men of the ſonnes of the Prophets went and ſtood to view a farre off; I maruell there were no more; How could any ſonne of the Prophets ſtay within his Colledge-walls that day; when hee knew what was meant to <hi>Elijah?</hi> Perhaps, though they knew that to be the Prophets laſt day; yet they might thinke his diſpariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be ſudden, and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; beſides, they found how much he affected ſecrecy in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended departure: yet the fiftie Prophets of <hi>Iericho</hi> will make proofe of their eies, &amp; with much
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:176654:180"/>intention aſſay who ſhall haue the laſt ſight of <hi>Elijah;</hi> Miracles are not purpoſed to ſilence and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; God will not worke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders without witneſſes; ſince hee doth them on purpoſe to win glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his name, his end were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate without their notice. Euen ſo, O Sauiour, when thou hadſt raiſed thy ſelfe from the dead, thou wouldſt bee ſeene of more than fiue hundred brethren at once; and when thou wouldſt raiſe vp thy glorified body from earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, thou didſt not aſcend from ſome cloſe valley, but from the mount of Oliues; not in the night, not alone, but in the cleere day, in the view of many eyes; which were ſo fixed vpon that point of thine heauen, that they
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:176654:180"/>could ſcarce bee remoued by the checke of Angels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iordan</hi> muſt be croſſed by <hi>Elijah</hi> in his way to heauen: There muſt be a meet parallel betwixt the two great Prophets, that ſhall meet Chriſt vpon <hi>Tabor; Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;</hi> Both receiued viſions on <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb,</hi> to both God appeared there in fire, and other formes of terrour; both were ſent to Kings; one to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the other to <hi>Ahab;</hi> Both prepared miraculous Tables, the one of Quailes and Manna in the Deſert, the other of Meale and Oyle in <hi>Sarepta;</hi> Both opened heauen, the one for that nouriſhing dew, the other for thoſe refreſhing ſhowres; Both reuenged Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with the ſword, the one vpon the worſhippers of the golden
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:176654:181"/>Calfe, the other vpon the foure hundred <hi>Baalites;</hi> Both quenched the drought of Iſrael, the one out of the Rocke, the other out of the Cloud; Both diuided the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the one of the Red ſea, the other of <hi>Iordan:</hi> Both of them are forewarned of their departure; Both muſt be fetcht away beyond <hi>Iordan;</hi> The body of <hi>Elijah</hi> is tranſlated, the body of <hi>Moſes</hi> is hid: What <hi>Moſes</hi> doth by his Rod, <hi>Elijah</hi> doth by his Mantle; with that he ſmites the waters, and they (as fearing the diuine power which wrought with the Prophet) run away from him; and ſtand on heapes, leauing their dry channell for the paſſage of thoſe awfull feet: It is not long ſince hee mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them with a generall exſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:176654:181"/>now he only bids them ſtand aſide, and giue way to his laſt walk; that he might with dry feet mount vp into the celeſtiall chariot.</p>
                     <p>The waters doe not now firſt obey him; they know that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of old; which hath oft giuen lawes to their falling, riſing, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they are paſt ouer; and now when <hi>Elijah</hi> findes himſelfe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on his laſt earth, he profers a munificent boone to his faithfull ſeruant, <hi>Aske what I ſhall doe for thee before I am taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee;</hi> I doe not heare him ſay, <hi>Aske of me when I am gone, In my glorified condition, I ſhall be more able to beſtead thee;</hi> but <hi>aske before I goe.</hi> We haue a communion with the Saints departed, not a commerce; when they are inabled to doe more for vs, they are leſſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:176654:182"/>apt to be ſolicited by vs; It is ſafe ſuing where we are ſure that wee are heard. Had not <hi>Elijah</hi> receiued a peculiar inſtinct for this profer, he had not beene thus liberall: It were preſumption to be bountifull on anothers coſt, without leaue of the owner; The mercy of our good God allowes his fauourites not onely to receiue, but to giue; not onely to receiue for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but to conuey bleſſings to others; What can that man want that is befriended of the faithfull?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſha</hi> needs not goe farre to ſeeke for a ſuit; It was in his heart, in his mouth; <hi>Let a double portion of thy ſpirit be vpon me.</hi> Euery Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet muſt bee a ſonne to <hi>Elijah;</hi> but <hi>Eliſha</hi> would be his heire, and craues the happy right of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:176654:182"/>the double ſhare to his brethren: It was not wealth, nor ſafetie, nor eaſe, nor honour that <hi>Eliſha</hi> cares for, the world lies open before him, he may take his choice; the reſt hee contemneth, nothing will ſerue him but a large meaſure of his maſters ſpirit; No carnall thought was guiltie of this ſacred ambition; Affectation of eminence was too baſe a conceit to fall into that man of God; He ſaw that the times needed ſtrong conuictions, he ſaw that he could not otherwiſe weild the ſucceſſion to ſuch a maſter, therefore he ſues for a double portion of ſpirit; the ſpirit of propheſie to foreknow, the ſpirit of power to worke; We cannot be too couetous, too am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of ſpirituall gifts, ſuch eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:176654:183"/>as may inable vs to win moſt aduantage to God in our vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Our wiſhes are the true touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of our eſtate; ſuch as wee wiſh to be, we are; worldly hearts affect earthly things, ſpirituall, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine; wee cannot better know what we are in deed, than by what we would be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Elijah</hi> acknowledges the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, and promiſes the grant of ſo great a requeſt: ſuſpended yet vpon the condition of <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> eye-ſight. <hi>If thou ſee mee when I am taken from thee, it ſhall be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; but if not, it ſhall not bee;</hi> What are the eyes to the furniture of the ſoule? What power is there in thoſe viſiue beames to draw downe a double portion of <hi>Elijahs</hi> Spirit? God doth not alwaies
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:176654:183"/>looke at efficacie and merit in the conditions of our actions, but at the freedome of his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; The eye was onely to bee imployed as the ſeruant of the heart; that the deſires might bee ſo much more intended with the ſight; Vehemence is the way to ſpeed both in earth, and in heauen; If but the eye-lids of <hi>Eliſha</hi> fall, if his thoughts ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, his hopes are daſhed; There muſt bee fixedneſſe and vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in thoſe that deſire double graces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Elijah</hi> was going on, and talking, when the Chariot of heauen came to fetch him; Surely, had not that conference been needful &amp; diuine, it had giuen way to meditation; and <hi>Elijah</hi> had beene taken vp rather
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:176654:184"/>from his knees, than from his feet; There can bee no better poſture, or ſtate, for the meſſenger of our diſſolution to finde vs in, than in a diligent proſecution of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, The buſie attendance of our holy vocation is no leſſe pleaſing to God, than an immediate deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Happy is the ſeruant whom the maſter (when he comes) ſhall finde ſo doing.</p>
                     <p>Oh the ſingular glory of <hi>Elijah!</hi> What mortall creature euer had this honour to be viſibly fetched by the Angels of God to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Euery ſoule of the elect is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and carried to bleſſedneſſe by thoſe inuiſible meſſengers, but, what fleſh and bloud was euer gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſuch a conuoy? There are three bodily Inhabitants of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:176654:184"/>Heauen; <hi>Henoch, Elijah,</hi> our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt. The firſt before the Law; the ſecond vnder the Law; the third vnder the Goſpell; All three in a ſeuerall forme of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Our bleſſed Sauiour raiſed himſelfe to and aboue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, by his owne immediate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; he aſcended as the ſonne, they as ſeruants; he as God, they as creatures; <hi>Elijah</hi> aſcended by the viſible miniſtery of Angels; <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> inſenſibly; Wherefore, O God, haſt thou done thus, but to giue vs a taſte of what ſhall be? to let vs ſee that heauen was neuer ſhut to the faithfull; to giue vs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the future glorification of this mortall and corruptible part?</p>
                     <p>Euen thus, O Sauiour, when
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:176654:185"/>thou ſhalt deſcend from heauen with a ſhout, with the voice of an Archangel, and with the trump of God, we that are aliue and remaine ſhall be caught vp together with the raiſed bodies of thy Saints, into the clouds, to meet thee in the aire, to dwell with thee in glory.</p>
                     <p>Many formes haue thoſe celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Spirits taken to themſelues in their apparitions to men; but of all other, moſt often hath the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie made his meſſengers <hi>a flame of fire;</hi> neuer more properly thau here; How had the Spirit of God kindled the hot fires of zeale in the breaſt of <hi>Elijah?</hi> How had this Prophet thrice commanded fire from heauen to earth? How fitly now at laſt doe theſe Seraphicall fires carie him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth to heauen?</p>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:176654:185"/>
                     <p>What doe wee ſee in this rapture of <hi>Elijah,</hi> but violence and terror, whirlewind and fire? two of thoſe fearefull repreſentations which the Prophet had in the rock of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb;</hi> Neuer any man entred into glory with eaſe; Euen the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable change hath ſome equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualency to a natural diſſolution. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though doubtleſſe to <hi>Elijah</hi> this fire had lightſomneſſe and reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not terror; this whirlwind had ſpeed, not violence; Thus haſt thou, O Sauiour, bidden vs when the Elements ſhall be diſſolued, &amp; the heauens ſhall be flaming about our eares, to lift vp our heads with ioy, becauſe our redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh. Come death, come fire, come whirlwind, they are worthy to be welcome that ſhall carie vs to immortalitie.</p>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:176654:186"/>
                     <p>This arreption was ſudden, yet <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſees both the Charet, and the horſes, and the aſcent; and cries to his now changed maſter, betweene heauen and earth, <hi>My father, my father, the charet of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and the horſe-men thereof. Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> of <hi>Abel-meholah,</hi> hath yeelded this title to <hi>Elijah;</hi> the naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to the ſpirituall; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them may bee neglected, but, after the yoke of oxen killed at the farewell, wee heare of no more greetings, no more bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of his bodily parent; and now that <hi>Elijah</hi> is taken from him, hee cries out, like a diſtreſſed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, <hi>My father, my father;</hi> and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath loſt the ſight of him, he rends his clothes in peeces, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the faſhion of the moſt
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:176654:186"/>paſſionate mourners; That <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſees his maſter halfe-way in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, cannot take away the ſorrow of his loſſe; The departure of a faithfull Prophet of God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our lamentation; Neither is it priuate affection that muſt ſway our griefe, but reſpects to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaies not onely, <hi>My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but <hi>the charet and horſe-men of Iſrael.</hi> That wee haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a father, ſhould not ſo much trouble vs, as that Iſrael hath loſt his guard. Certainly, the view of this heauenly charet and horſes that came for <hi>Elijah,</hi> puts <hi>Eliſha</hi> in minde of that charet and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which <hi>Elijah</hi> was to Iſrael. Theſe were Gods charet, <hi>Elijah</hi> was theirs: Gods charet and theirs are vpon the ſame wheeles mounted
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:176654:187"/>into heauen; No forces are ſo ſtrong as the ſpirituall; the prayers of an <hi>Elijah</hi> are more powerfull than all the Armies of fleſh; The firſt thing that this Seer diſcernes, after the ſeparation of his maſter, is, the nakedneſſe of Iſrael in his loſſe. If we muſter Souldiers, and leeſe zealous Prophets, it is but a wofull exchange.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Elijahs</hi> Mantle fals from him in the riſing; there was no vſe of that, whither he was going, there was, whence he was taken: <hi>Eliſha</hi> iuſtly takes vp this deare monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glorified maſter; A good ſupply for his rent garments; This was it which (in preſage of his future right) <hi>Elijah</hi> inueſted him withall, vpon the firſt ſight, when he was ploughing with the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:176654:187"/>twelue yoke of oxen; now it fals from heauen to his poſſeſſion; I doe not fee him adore ſo precious a relique, I ſee him take it vp, and caſt it about him; Penſiue and maſterleſſe doth hee now come backe to the bankes of <hi>Iordan,</hi> whoſe ſtreame he muſt paſſe in his returne to the Schooles of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Ere while he ſaw what way that riuer gaue to the mantle of <hi>Elijah;</hi> he knew that power was not in the cloth, but in the Spirit of him that wore it; to trie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether he were no leſſe the heire of that ſpirit, than of that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he <hi>tooke the mantle of Elijah</hi> and ſmote the waters, and ſaid, <hi>Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Eliſha</hi> doth not expoſtulate, and challenge, but pray; As if he ſaid,

                        <hi>Lord God it was thy promiſe to me by my departed maſter, that if I ſhould ſee him in his last paſſage, a double portion of his Spirit ſhould be vpon me: I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him with my eies in that fire, and whirlewind; now therefore, O God, make good thy gracious word to thy ſeruant; ſhew ſome token vpon mee for good; make this the first proofe of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power wherewith thou ſhalt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due me; Let Iordan giue the ſame way to me, that it gaue to my master.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly the ſtreame (as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the ſame Mantle, though in another hand) diuides it ſelfe, and yeelds paſſage to the ſucceſſor of <hi>Elijah.</hi>

                     <p>The fifty ſonnes of the Prophets hauing beene a farre off witneſſes of theſe admirable euents, doe well ſee that <hi>Elijah</hi> (though tranſlated
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:176654:188"/>in bodie) hath yet left his Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him; they meet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and bow themſelues to the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; It was not the out-ſide of <hi>Elijah</hi> which they had wont to ſtoop vnto, with ſo much venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was his Spirit; which ſince they now finde in another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, they intertaine with equall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence; No enuy, no emulation raiſeth vp their ſtomackes againſt <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſeruant, but where they ſee eminent graces, they are willingly proſtrate. Thoſe that are truly gracious, doe no leſſe reioyce in the riches of others gifts, than humbly vnder-value their owne; Theſe men were trained vp in the ſchooles of the Prophets, <hi>Eliſha</hi> at the plough and cart, yet now they ſtand not vpon termes of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:176654:189"/>their worth, and his meanneſſe, but meekely fall downe before him whom God will honour; It is not to be regarded who the man is, but whom God would make him; The more vnlikely the meanes is, the more is the glory of the workman: It is the praiſe of an holy ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to magnifie the graces of God where euer it finds them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe yong Prophets are no leſſe full of zeale, than reuerence; zeale to <hi>Elijah,</hi> reuerence to <hi>Eliſha;</hi> They ſee <hi>Elijah</hi> carried vp into the ayre; they knew this was not the firſt time of his ſupernaturall remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall; Imagining it therefore poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Spirit of God had caſt him vpon ſome remote mountaine, or valley, they profer he labour of their ſeruants to ſeeke

Why had they not all this while, made their mone to <hi>Elijah?</hi>
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:176654:191"/>was it that they were more awed with his greater auſterity? Or was it that they met not with ſo fit an opportunity of his commoration amongſt them? It was told them what power <hi>Eliſha</hi> had exerciſed vpon the waters of <hi>Iordan,</hi> &amp; now they ply him for theirs; Examples of beneficence eaſily moue vs to a requeſt, &amp; expectation of fauours.</p>
                     <p>What ailed the waters of <hi>Iericho?</hi> Surely, originally they were not ill affected; No men could be ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as to build a citie, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earth, nor water could be vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; Meere proſpect could not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie men to the neglect of health, &amp; profit. <hi>Hiel</hi> the <hi>Bethelite</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue reedified it with the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of a curſe, ſo lately as in the daies of <hi>Ahab,</hi> if it had bin of old notorious
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:176654:191"/>for ſo foule an annoyance: Not therefore the ancient malediction of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> not the neighborhood of that noyſome lake of <hi>Sodome,</hi> was guilty of this diſeaſe of the ſoyle, &amp; waters, but the late ſinnes of the inhabitants. <hi>He turneth the riuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wilderneſſe, and water-ſprings into a drie ground; a fruitfull land into bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe, for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein;</hi> How oft haue we ſeene the ſame field both full and famiſhing? How oft the ſame waters both ſafe, and by ſome irruption, or new tincture, hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Howſoeuer naturall cauſes may concurre, heauen and earth, and ayre, and waters follow the temper of our ſoules, of our liues; &amp; are therfore indiſpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſo: <hi>Iericho</hi> began now
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:176654:192"/>to make it ſelfe capable of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate, ſince it was now become a receptacle of Prophets; <hi>Eliſha</hi> is willing to gratifie his hoſts; it is reaſon that any place ſhould fare the better for the preſence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines: The medicine is more ſtrange than the diſeaſe. <hi>Bring me a new Cruſe and put ſalt therein:</hi> Why a Cruſe? why new? why Salt in that new Cruſe? How ſhould Salt make water potable? Or, if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch vertue in it, what could a Cruſe full doe to a whole current? Or, if that meaſure were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, what was the age of the Cruſe to the force of the Salt? Yet <hi>Eliſha</hi> calls for Salt in a new Cruſe. God (who wrought this by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) is a free agent; as he will not binde his power to meanes; ſo will
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:176654:192"/>he by his power binde vnlikely meanes to performe his will.</p>
                     <p>Naturall proprieties haue no place in miraculous workes: No leſſe eaſie is it for God to worke by contrary, than ſubordinate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet doth not caſt the Salt into the channell, but into the ſpring of the waters: If the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine be redreſſed, the ſtreames cannot be faultie; as contrarily, the purity and ſoundnes of the ſtreame auailes nothing to the redreſſe of the fountaine: Reformation muſt begin at the well-head of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe; The order of being is a good guide to the methode of amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: Vertue doth not run back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; Had <hi>Eliſha</hi> caſt the Salt into the brooks and ditches, the remedy
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:176654:193"/>muſt haue ſtriuen againſt the ſtreame, to reach vp to the ſpring; now it is but one labour to cure the fountaine; Our heart is a well of bitter and venomous water, our actions are the ſtreames; In vaine ſhall we cleanſe our hands, whiles our hearts are euill.</p>
                     <p>The Cruſe and the Salt muſt be their owne; The act muſt be his; the power, Gods; <hi>He caſt the Salt into the ſpring,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I haue healed theſe waters; there ſhall not be from thence any more death, or barrenneſſe.</hi> Farre was it from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> to challenge ought to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; Before, when he ſhould diuide the waters of <hi>Iordan,</hi> he did not ſay, Where is the power of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> but, Where is the Lord God of <hi>Elijah?</hi> and now, when he ſhould cure the

                     <p>As the generall viſitor of the Schooles of the Prophets, <hi>Eliſha</hi> paſſeth from <hi>Iericho</hi> to that other colledge at <hi>Bethel. Bethel</hi> was a place of ſtrange compoſition; there was at once the golden Calfe of <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> and the Schoole of God: True religion and idolatrie found a free harbour within thoſe walls; I doe not maruell that Gods Prophets would plant there; there was the moſt need of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, where they found the ſpring head of corruption; Phyſitians are of moſt vſe where diſeaſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound: <hi>As he was going vp by the way, there came forth little children out of the cittie, and mocked him, and ſaid to him, Goe vp thou bald-head; Goe vp thou bald-head.</hi> Euen the very boyes of <hi>Bethel</hi> haue learned to ſcoffe at a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:176654:194"/>Prophet; The ſpight of their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous parents is eaſily propagated; Children are ſuch as their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Infancy is led altogether by imitation, it hath neither words, nor actions, but infuſed by others; If it haue good or ill language, it is but borrowed; and the ſhame or thanke is due to thoſe that lent it.</p>
                     <p>What was it that theſe ill-taught children vpbraided to the Prophet, but a ſleight naturall defect, not worthy the name of a blemiſh, the want of a little haire; at the beſt, a comely excrement, no part of the body; Had there beene deformitie in that ſmoothneſſe of the head, which ſome great wits haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with praiſes, a faultleſſe and remedileſſe eye-ſore had beene no fit matter for a taunt: How ſmall
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:176654:195"/>occaſions will be taken to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace a Prophet? If they could haue ſaid ought worſe, <hi>Eliſha</hi> had not heard of this; God had crowned that head with honor, which the <hi>Bethelitiſh</hi> children loaded with ſcorne: Who would haue thought the rude termes of waggiſh boyes worthy of any thing but neglect? <hi>Eliſha</hi> lookes at them with ſeuere browes, and (like the heire of him that cald downe fire vpon the two Captaines and their fifties) curſes them in the name of the Lord; Two ſhe-Beares out of the wood haſten to be his executioners, and teare two and fortie of them in peeces. O fearefull example of diuine Iuſtice! This was not the reuenge of an angry Prophet, it was the puniſhment of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:176654:195"/>Iudge: God and his Seer lookt through theſe children, at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, at all Iſrael; he would puniſh the parents miſ-nurturing their children (to the contemptuous v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of a Prophet) with the death of thoſe children, which they had miſ-taught: He would teach <hi>Iſrael</hi> what it was to miſ-uſe a Prophet: And if he would not endure theſe contumelies vnreuenged in the mouthes of children, what ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance was enough for aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors?</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſſe ſome of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped to tell the newes of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; what lamentation doe we think there was in the ſtreets of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel?</hi> how did the diſtreſſed mothers wring their hands for this wofull orbation? And now when they
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:176654:196"/>came forth to fetch the remnants of their owne fleſh, what a ſad ſpectacle it was to finde the fields ſtrawed with thoſe mangled car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keiſes? It is an vnprofitable ſorrow that followes a iudgement; Had theſe Parents beene as carefull to traine vp their children in good diſcipline, and to correct their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, as they are now paſſionate in bemoaning their loſſe, this ſlaughter had neuer been; In vaine doe wee looke for good of thoſe children, whoſe education wee haue neglected; In vaine doe wee grieue for thoſe miſcarriages which our care might haue preuented.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſha</hi> knew the ſucceſſe, yet doth he not balke the Citie of <hi>Bethel;</hi> Doe we not wonder that the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impatience of thoſe parents,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:176654:196"/>whom the curſe of <hi>Eliſha</hi> robbed of their children, did not breake forth to ſome malicious practiſe againſt the Prophet? Would wee not thinke the Prophet might miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt ſome hard meaſure from thoſe exaſperated Citizens? There lay his way; he followes God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of men; as well knowing that either they durſt not, or they could not act violence. They knew there were Beares in the wood, and fires in heauen; and if their malice would haue ventured aboue their courage, they could haue no more power ouer <hi>Eliſha</hi> in the ſtreets, than thoſe hungry beaſts had in the way. Whither dare not a Prophet goe when God cals him? Hauing viſited the ſchooles of the Prophets, <hi>Eliſha</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:176654:197"/>to mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and after ſome holy ſolitarineſſe, returnes to the Citie of <hi>Samaria;</hi> He can neuer be a profitable Seer, that is either alwaies, or neuer alone; <hi>Carmel</hi> ſhall fit him for <hi>Samaria;</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation for action; That mother Citie of <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt needs affoord him moſt worke: Yet is the throne of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ſucceeded by a brother leſſe ill than himſelfe, than the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of both: <hi>Ahabs</hi> impietie hath not a perfect heire of <hi>Iehoram:</hi> That ſonne of his hates his <hi>Baal,</hi> though he keepes his calues. Euen into the moſt wicked families it pleaſeth God to caſt his powerfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, that all are not equally vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: It is no newes to ſee lewd men make ſcruple of ſome ſinnes; The world were not to liue in, if
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:176654:197"/>all ſinnes were affected by all. It is no thanke to <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezebel</hi> that their ſonne is no Baalite: As no good is traduced from parents, ſo not all euill; there is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie hand that ſtops the foule current of nature, at his pleaſure: No Idolater can ſay, that his childe ſhall not be a conuert.</p>
                     <p>The affinitie betwixt the houſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iuda,</hi> holds good in ſucceſſion; <hi>Iehoram</hi> inherits the friendſhip, the aid of <hi>Iehoſhaphat:</hi> whoſe counſell (as is moſt likely) had cured him of that Baaliſme. It was a iuſt warre whereto he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licites the good King of <hi>Iudah:</hi> The King of <hi>Moah</hi> (who had beene an ancient Tributarie from the daies of <hi>Dauid</hi>) falls now from his homage, and refuſes to pay his
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:176654:198"/>hundred thouſand Lambes, and hundred thouſand Rammes with fleeces, to the King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> The backes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> can ill miſſe the wooll of <hi>Moah;</hi> they will put on iron to recouer their cloth. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi> had beene once well chid, well frighted, for ioyning with <hi>Ahab</hi> againſt <hi>Aram;</hi> yet doth he not ſticke now againe to come into the field with <hi>Iehoram</hi> againſt <hi>Moab;</hi> The caſe is more fauourable, leſſe dangerous; <hi>Baal</hi> is caſt downe; The Images of the falſe gods are gone, though the falſe Images of the true God ſtand ſtill; Beſides, this rebellious <hi>Moab</hi> had ioyned with the <hi>Syrians</hi> formerly againſt <hi>Iudah;</hi> ſo as <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> is intereſſed in the reuenge.</p>
                     <p>After reſolution of the end,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:176654:198"/>wiſely doe theſe Kings deliberate of the way. It is agreed to paſſe through <hi>Edom;</hi> that Kingdome was annexed to the Crowne of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi> well might <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> make bold with his owne: It was (it ſeemes) a march farre about in the meaſure of the way, but neereſt to their purpoſe: the aſſault would be thus more eaſie, if the paſſage were more tedious; The three Kings of <hi>Iſrael, Iudah, Edom,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Armies, are vpon foot. They are no ſooner comne into the parching wildes of <hi>Edom,</hi> than they are ready to die for thirſt; If the channels were farre off, yet the waters were further; the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching beames of the Sunne haue dried them vp; and haue left thoſe riuers more fit for walke, than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment;
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:176654:199"/>What are the greateſt Monarchs of the world, if they want but water to their mouthes? What can their Crownes, and Plumes, &amp; rich Armes auaile them when they are abridged but of that which is the drinke of beaſts? With dry tongues and lips, doe they now conferre of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſery; <hi>Ieboram</hi> deplores the calamitie, into which they were fallen; but <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> askes for a Prophet; Euery man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile a miſchiefe; euery man cannot finde the way out of it: ſtill yet I heare good <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> ſpeake too late; Hee ſhould haue inquired for a Prophet, ere he had gone forth; ſo had hee auoided theſe ſtraits; Not to conſult at all with God, is <hi>Iehorams</hi> ſinne; to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:176654:199"/>conſult late, is <hi>Iehoſhaphats;</hi> the former is atheous careleſneſſe, the latter, forgetfull ouer-ſight; The beſt man may ſlacken good duties, the worſt contemnes them.</p>
                     <p>Not without ſome ſpecialty from God doth <hi>Eliſha</hi> follow the camp: Elſe, that had beene no Element for a Prophet; Little did the good King of <hi>Iudah</hi> thinke that God was ſo neere him; Purpoſely, was this holy Seer ſent for the ſuccour of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> and his faithfull followers, when they were ſo farre from dreaming of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie, that they knew not of a danger: It would bee wide with the beſt men, if the eie of diuine prouidence were not open vpon them, when the eie of their care is
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:176654:200"/>ſhut towards it; How well did <hi>Eliſha</hi> in the warres? The ſtrongeſt ſquadron of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was within that breaſt; All their armours of proofe had not ſo much ſafetie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as his Mantle; Though the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would take no notice of the Prophet, yet one of his Courtiers did, <hi>Here is Eliſha the ſonne of Shaphat, which powred water on the hands of Elijah;</hi> This follower of <hi>Iehoram</hi> knowes <hi>Eliſha</hi> by his owne name, by his fathers, by his maſters; The Court of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was profane, and Idolatrous enough, yet, euen there Gods Prophet had both knowledge, and honour; His very ſeruice to <hi>Elijah</hi> was enough to winne him reuerence; It is better to bee an attendant of ſome man, than to be attended by
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:176654:200"/>many: That he had powred water on <hi>Elijahs</hi> hands, was inſinuation enough, that he could powere out water for thoſe three Kings: The three Kings walke downe (by the motion of <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi>) to the man of God; It was newes to ſee three Kings going downe to the ſeruant of him, who ranne before the charet of <hi>Ahab:</hi> Religion and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie haue both of them much power of humiliation, I know not whether more; Either zeale or need will make a Prophet hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>How ſharply dares the man of God to chide his Soueraigne, the King of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> The libertie of the Prophets was no leſſe ſingular, than their calling; He that would borrow their tongue, muſt ſhew
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:176654:201"/>their Commiſſion; As God repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Kings for their ſakes, ſo did not they ſticke to reproue Kings for his ſake: Thus much freedome they muſt leaue to their ſucceſſors, that wee may not ſpare the vices of them, whoſe perſons we muſt ſpare.</p>
                     <p>Iuſtly is <hi>Iehoram</hi> turn'd off to the Prophets of his father, and the Prophets of his mother; It is but right, and equall, that thoſe which we haue made the comfort and ſtay of our peace, ſhould be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of our extremitie; If our proſperitie haue made the world our God, how worthily ſhall our death-bed be choaked with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration? Neither would the caſe beare an Apologie, nor the time an expoſtulation; <hi>Iehoram</hi>
                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:176654:201"/>cannot excuſe, he can complaine; he findes that now three Kings, three Kingdomes are at the mercy of one Prophet; it was time for him to ſpeak faire; nothing ſounds from him but lamentations, and intreaties; Nay, for the Lord hath called theſe three Kings together to deliuer them into the hand of <hi>Moab; Iehoram</hi> hath ſo much grace as to confeſſe the impotencie of thoſe, hee had truſted; and the power of that God whom hee had neglected; Euery ſinner cannot ſee, and acknowledge the hand of God in his ſufferings; Already hath the diſtreſſed Prince gained ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by this miſery; None com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines ſo much as he, none feeles ſo much as he; All the reſt ſuffer for him, &amp; therefore he ſuffers in them all.</p>

How vnſeaſonable are ſongs to an heauy heart? It was not for their eares, it was for his owne boſome, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> called for Muſicke: that his ſpirits after their zealous agitation, might be ſweetly compoſed, and put into a meet temper, for receiuing the calme viſions of God: Perhaps it was ſome holy Leuite, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Campe of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> whoſe minſtrelſie was required,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:176654:203"/>for ſo ſacred a purpoſe: None but a quiet breaſt is capable of diuine Reuelations; Nothing is more powerfull to ſettle a troubled heart than a melodious harmony; The Spirit of propheſie was not the more inuited, the Prophets Spirit was the better diſpoſed, by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſounds: The ſame God that will reueale his will to the Prophet, ſuggeſts this demand; <hi>Bring me a Minstrell;</hi> How many ſay thus when they would put God from them? Profane mirth, wanton muſicke debauches the ſoule; and makes no leſſe roome for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane Spirit, than ſpirituall melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die doth for the Diuine.</p>
                     <p>No Prophet had euer the Spirit at command; The hand of the Minſtrell can do nothing without
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:176654:204"/>the hand of the Lord; Whiles the Muſicke ſounds in the eare, God ſpeakes to the heart of <hi>Eliſha; Thus ſaith the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches; Ye ſhall not ſee wind, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall ye ſee raine, yet that valley ſhall be full of water, &amp;c.</hi> To ſee wind, and raine in the height of that drought, would haue ſeemed as wonderfull, as pleaſing; but, to ſee abundance of water, without wind or raine, was yet more mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; I know not how the ſight of the meanes abates our admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the effect; Where no cauſes can be found out, we are forced to confeſſe omnipotency; <hi>Elijah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued <hi>Iſrael</hi> with water, but it was out of the cloudes, and thoſe cloudes roſe from the ſea; but whence <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſhall fetch it, is not

                     <p>All that euening, all that night muſt the faith of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> be exerciſed with expectation; At the houre of the morning ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice no ſooner did the bloud of that Oblation guſh forth, than the ſtreames of waters guſhed forth into their new channels, and filled the Countrey with a refreſhing moiſture; <hi>Elijah</hi> fetcht downe his fire, at the houre of the euening ſacrifice; <hi>Eliſha</hi> fetcht vp his water, at the houre of the morning ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; God giues reſpect to his owne houres, for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our obſeruation; If his wiſdome hath ſet vs any peculiar times, we cannot keepe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bleſſing; The deuotions of all true <hi>Iewes</hi> (all the world ouer)

                     <p>The Prophet hath aſſured the Kings, not of water onely, but of victory; <hi>Moab</hi> heares of enemies, and is addreſſed to warre; Their owne error ſhall cut their throats; they riſe ſoone enough to beguile themſelues; the beames of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Sunne gliſtering vpon thoſe vaporous, and vnexpected waters, carried in the eies of ſome <hi>Moabites</hi> a ſemblance of bloud; a few eies were enough to fill all eares with a falſe noiſe; the deceiued ſenſe miſ-carries the imagination; <hi>This is bloud, the Kings are ſurely ſlaine,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:176654:205"/>and they haue ſmitten one another;</hi> now therefore, <hi>Moab</hi> to the ſpoile: Ciuill broyles giue iuſt aduantage to a common enemy; Therefore muſt the Camps be ſpoiled, becauſe the Kings haue ſmitten each other. Thoſe that ſhall bee deceiued, are giuen ouer to credulitie; The <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> doe not examine either the conceit, or the report; but flie in, confuſedly, vpon the Camp of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> whom they finde, too late, to haue no enemies but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; As if death would not haue haſtened enough to them, they come to fetch it, they come to challenge it; It ſeizeth vpon them vnauoidably; they are ſmitten, their Cities razed, their Lands marred, their Wells ſtopped, their trees felled; as if God meant to

                     <p>No onſets are ſo furious as the laſt aſſaults of the deſperate; The King of <hi>Moab</hi> now hopeleſſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery, would be glad to ſhut vp with a pleaſing reuenge; with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hundred reſolute followers, he ruſhes into the battle, towards the King of <hi>Edom;</hi> as if he would bid death welcome, might he but carrie with him that deſpighted neighbour; &amp; now, mad with the repulſe, he returnes: and whether as angry with his deſtiny, or as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly affecting, to win his cruel gods with ſo deare a ſacrifice, hee offers them with his owne hand the bloud of his eldeſt ſonne in the ſight of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſends him vp in ſmoake to thoſe helliſh Deities.

Better, not as good; than the waters, not the riuers; all the waters, <hi>Iordan,</hi> and all the reſt; of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Region to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> No where ſhall we finde a truer patterne of the diſpoſition of nature; how ſhe is altogether led by ſenſe, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; how ſhe fondly iudges of all obiects by the appearance, how ſhe acquaints her ſelfe onely with the common rode of Gods procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; how ſhe ſticks to her owne principles, how ſhe miſ-conſtrues the intentions of God, how ſhee ouer-conceits her owne, how ſhe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:176654:230"/>diſdaines the meane conditions of others, how ſhe vpbraids her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites with the proud compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her owne priuiledges.</p>
                     <p>Nature is neuer but like her ſelfe; No maruell if carnall mindes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, the ſimplicitie of Sacraments, the homelineſſe of ceremonies, the ſeeming inefficacie of cenſures: Theſe men look vpon <hi>Iordan</hi> with <hi>Syrian</hi> eies; One drop of whoſe water ſet apart by diuine ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath more vertue, than all the ſtreames of <hi>Abana,</hi> and <hi>Pharphar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a good matter for a man to be attended with wiſe and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full followers; Many a one hath had better counſell from his heels, than from his elbowes: <hi>Naamans</hi> ſeruants were his beſt friends: they
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:176654:231"/>came to him, and ſpake to him, and ſaid, <hi>My Father, If the Prophet had bid thee doe ſome great thing, wouldſt thou not haue done it? How much rather then, when hee ſaith to thee, Waſh, and be cleane.</hi> Theſe men were ſeruants not of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but of the profit of their maſter; Some ſeruile Spirits would haue cared onely to ſooth vp, not to benefit their Gouernour; and would haue incouraged his rage, by their owne; Sir, will you take this at the hand of a baſe fellow? Was euer man thus flouted? Will you let him carrie it away thus? Is any harmleſſe anger ſufficient reuenge for ſuch an inſolence? Giue vs leaue at leaſt to pull him out by the cares, and force him to doe that by violence, which hee
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:176654:231"/>would not doe out of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Let our fingers teach this ſaucy Prophet what it is to offer an affront to a Prince of <hi>Syria:</hi> But theſe men loued more their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters health, than his paſſion; and had rather therefore to aduiſe, than flatter; to draw him to good, than follow him to euill; Since it was a Prophet from whom he receiued this preſcription, they perſwade him not to deſpiſe it; intimating there could bee no fault in the ſleightneſſe of the receit, ſo long as there was no defect of power in the commander; that the vertue of the cure ſhould be in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not in the nature of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie: They perſwade, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. Next to the Prophet, <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> may thanke his ſeruants that
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:176654:232"/>he is not a Leper; He goes downe (vpon their intreatie) and dips ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times in <hi>Iordan,</hi> his fleſh riſeth, his leproſie vaniſheth; Not the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt furie and techineſſe of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhall croſſe the cure: leſt whiles God is ſeuere, the Prophet ſhould bee diſcredited. Long enough might <hi>Naaman</hi> haue waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in vaine, if <hi>Eliſha</hi> had not ſent him; Many a Leper hath ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in that ſtreame, and hath come forth no leſſe impure; It is the word, the ordinance of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie which puts efficacy into thoſe meanes, which of themſelues are both impotent, and improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; What can our Font doe to the waſhing away of ſinne? If Gods inſtitution ſhall put vertue into our <hi>Iordan,</hi> it ſhall ſcoure off the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:176654:232"/>leproſies of our hearts; and ſhall more cure the ſoule, than cleanſe the face.</p>
                     <p>How ioyfull is <hi>Naaman</hi> to ſee this change of his skinne, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation of his fleſh; of his life: Neuer did his heart finde ſuch warmth of in ward gladneſſe, as in this ſtreame.</p>
                     <p>Vpon the ſight of his recouerie, hee doth not poſt home to the Court, or to his family, to call for witneſſes, for partners of his ioy; but thankfully returnes to the Prophet, by whoſe meanes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this mercy; He comes back with more contentment, than hee departed with rage; Now will the man of God be ſeene of that reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered <hi>Syrian,</hi> whom hee would not ſee leprous: His preſence ſhall
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:176654:233"/>be yeelded to the gratulation, which was not yeelded to the ſuit; Purpoſely did <hi>Eliſha</hi> forbeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might ſhare no part of the praiſe of this worke, with his Maker; that God might be ſo much more magnified, as the meanes were more weake, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable. The miracle hath his due worke; Firſt, doth <hi>Naaman</hi> acknowledge the God that wrought it; then, the Prophet, by whom he wrought it: <hi>Behold, now I know there is no God in all the earth, but in Iſrael.</hi> Oh happy <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> that was at once cured of his leproſie, and his meſ-priſon of God; <hi>Naaman</hi> was too wiſe, to thinke that either the water had cured him, or the man; hee ſaw a diuine power working in both;
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:176654:233"/>ſuch as he vainly ſought from his Heathen Deities; with the heart therefore hee beleeues, with the mouth he confeſſes.</p>
                     <p>Whiles hee is thus thankfull to the author of his cure, he is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of the inſtrument, <hi>Now therefore, I pray thee, take a bleſsing of thy ſeruant; Naaman</hi> came richly furniſhed with ten talents of ſiluer, ſix thouſand peeces of gold, ten changes of rayment; All theſe and many more would the Syrian Peere haue gladly giuen to bee deliuered from ſo noyſome a diſeaſe; No maruell if he importunately offer ſome part of them to the Prophet, now that he is deliuered; ſome te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of thankfulneſſe did well, where all earthly recompence was too ſhort; The hands of this man
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:176654:234"/>were no leſſe full of thanks, than his mouth; Dry and barren profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our obligations, where is power to requite, are vnfit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ingenuous ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Naaman</hi> is not more frank in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his gratuitie, than <hi>Eliſha</hi> vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in refuſing it, <hi>As the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, before whom I ſtand, I wil receiue none.</hi> Not that he thought the Syrian gold impure; Not that he thought it vnlawfull to take vp a gift, where he hath laid downe a benefit; But the Prophet will remit of <hi>Naamans</hi> purſe, that he may win of his ſoule; The man of God would haue his new conuert ſee cauſe to be more enamoured of true pietie; which teacheth her Clients to contemne thoſe worldly riches and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which baſe worldlings adore:
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:176654:234"/>and would haue him thinke, that theſe miraculous powers are ſo farre tranſcending the valuation of all earthly pelfe, that thoſe glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering treaſures are worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but contempt, in reſpect thereof; Hence it is, that he who refuſed not the Shunamites table, and ſtoole, and candleſticke, will not take <hi>Naamans</hi> preſent: There is much vſe of godly diſcretion in directing vs when to open, when to ſhut our hands.</p>
                     <p>Hee that will not be allowed to giue, deſires yet to take: <hi>Shall there not, I pray thee, bee giuen to thy ſeruant two mules load of earth? for thy ſeruant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering, nor ſacrifice to other Gods, but vnto the Lord.</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh mold lay open to his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:176654:235"/>without leaue of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> but <hi>Naaman</hi> regards not to take it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it may be giuen him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by the Prophets hand; Well did this Syrian finde that the man of God had giuen a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vertue to the water of Iſrael; and therefore ſuppoſed hee might giue the like to his earth; Neither would any earth ſerue him but <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaes;</hi> elſe the mold of Iſrael had beene more properly craued of the King, than the Prophet of Iſrael.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſſe it was deuotion that moued this ſuit; The Syrian ſaw God had a proprietie in Iſrael, and imagines that he will be beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his owne; On the ſudden was <hi>Naaman</hi> halfe a Proſelyte, ſtill here was a weake knowledge with ſtrong intentions; Hee will ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:176654:235"/>to the Lord; but where? in <hi>Syria,</hi> not in <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> Not the mold, but the Altar is that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; which he hath allowed no where but in his choſen <hi>Sion;</hi> This honeſt <hi>Syrian</hi> will bee remouing God home to his Countrey; hee ſhould haue reſolued to remoue his home, to God; And though he vowes to offer no ſacrifice to any other god, yet he craues leaue to offer an outward curteſie to <hi>Rimmon;</hi> though not for the Idols ſake, yet for his maſters: <hi>In this thing the Lord pardon thy ſeruant, that when my master goeth into the houſe of Rimmon, to worſhip there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow my ſelfe in the houſe of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy ſeruant in this thing Naaman</hi> goes away reſolute to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:176654:236"/>himſelfe an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; all the <hi>Syrian</hi> Court ſhall know that he ſacrifices vpon Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiſh earth, to the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> they ſhall heare him proteſt to haue neither heart, nor knee for <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> If he muſt goe into the houſe of that Idoll, it ſhall be as a ſeruant, not as a ſuppliant; his dutie to his maſter ſhall carrie him, not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to his maſters god; If his maſter goe to worſhip there, not he; neither doth he ſay, <hi>When I bow my ſelfe to the Image of Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> but, <hi>in the houſe:</hi> hee ſhall bow, to bee leaned vpon, not to adore; yet had not <hi>Naaman</hi> thought this a fault, he had not craued a pardon; his heart told him that a perfect conuert ſhould not haue abid the roofe, the ſight,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:176654:236"/>the ayre of <hi>Rimmon;</hi> that his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of an earthly maſter ſhould not draw him to the ſemblance of an act of outward obſeruance, to the riuall of his maſter in heauen; that a ſincere deteſtation of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could not ſtand with ſo vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a curteſie.</p>
                     <p>Farre therefore is <hi>Naaman</hi> from being a patterne, ſaue of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſince hee is yet more than halfe a <hi>Syrian;</hi> ſince hee willingly accuſes himſelfe, and in ſtead of defending, deprecates his offence; It is not for vs to expect a full ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the cradle of conuerſion. As nature, ſo grace riſes by many degrees, to perfection; Leproſie was in <hi>Naaman</hi> cured at once, not corruption.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet, as glad to ſee him
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:176654:237"/>but thus forward, diſmiſſes him with a ciuill valediction; Had an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> made this ſuit, hee had beene anſwered, with a checke; thus much from a <hi>Syrian</hi> was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a kinde farewell; They are parted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gehezi</hi> cannot thus take his leaue; His heart is maled vp in the rich cheſts of <hi>Naaman,</hi> and now he goes to fetch it: The Prophet and his man had not looked with the ſame eies vpon the <hi>Syrian</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the one with the eie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the other with the eie of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and couetous deſire. The diſpoſition of the maſter may not be meaſured by the minde, by the act of his ſeruant; Holy <hi>Eliſha</hi> may be attended by a falſe <hi>Gehezi;</hi> No examples, no counſels will
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:176654:237"/>preuaile with ſome hearts; who would not haue thought that the follower of <hi>Eliſha</hi> could bee no other than a Saint? yet, after the view of all thoſe miracles, this man is a mirror of worldlineſſe: Hee thinkes his maſter either too ſimple, or too kinde, to refuſe ſo iuſt a preſent from a <hi>Syrian;</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will be more wiſe, more fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall; Deſire haſtens his pace, hee doth not goe, but runne after his bootie: <hi>Naaman</hi> ſees him, and, as true nobleneſſe is euer courteous, alights from his Charet, to meet him; The great Lord of <hi>Syria</hi> comes forth of his coach to ſalute a Prophets ſeruant; not fearing that he can humble himſelfe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much to one of <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> family; He greets <hi>Gehezi</hi> with the ſame
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:176654:238"/>word wherewith he was lately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his maſter; <hi>Is it peace?</hi> So ſudden a meſſenger might ſeeme to argue ſome change; Hee ſo one receiues from the breathleſſe bearer newes of his maſters health; and requeſt; <hi>All is well; My master hath ſent me, ſaying, Behold, euen now there be come to me from mount Ephraim, two young men of the ſons of the Prophets; Giue mee, I pray thee, a talent of ſiluer, and two chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of garments.</hi> Had <hi>Gehezi</hi> cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a reward in his owne name, calling for the fee of the Prophets ſeruant; as the gaine ſo the offence had beene the leſſe, now, reaching at a greater ſumme, hee belies his maſter, robs <hi>Naaman,</hi> burdens his owne ſoule. What a ſound tale hath the craft of <hi>Gehezi</hi> deuiſed?
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:176654:238"/>Of the number, the place, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, the age of his maſters gueſts? That hee might ſet a faire colour vpon that pretended requeſt; ſo proportioning the value of his demand, as might both inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and yet well ſtand with the moderation of his maſter: Loue of money can neuer keep good quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with honeſtie, with innocence; Couetouſneſſe neuer lodg'd in the heart alone; if it finde not, it will breed wickedneſſe: What a mint of fraud there is in a worldly breaſt? How readily can it coyne ſuttle falſhoods for an aduantage?</p>
                     <p>How thankfully liberall was this Noble <hi>Syrian; Gehezi</hi> could not be more eager in taking, than hee was in giuing; As glad of ſo happy an occaſion of leauing any peece
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:176654:239"/>of his treaſure behinde him, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces two Talents vpon the ſeruant of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> and bindes them in two bags, and laies them vpon two of his owne ſeruants; his own traine ſhall yeeld Porters to <hi>Gehezi:</hi> Cheerefulneſſe is the iuſt praiſe of our beneficence: Bountifull minds are as zealous in ouer-paying good turnes, as the niggardly are in ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting retributions.</p>
                     <p>What proiects doe we thinke <hi>Gehezi</hi> had all the way? How did he pleaſe himſelfe with the waking dreames of purchaſes, of traffique, of iollitie? and now, when they are comne to the tower, he gladly disburdens, and diſmiſſes his two <hi>Syrian</hi> attendants, and hides their load, and wipes his mouth, and ſtands boldly before that maſter,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:176654:239"/>whom he had ſo foulely abuſed; Oh <hi>Gebezi!</hi> where didſt thou think God was this while? Couldſt thou thus long powre water vpon the hands of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and be either ignorant, or regardleſſe of that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiueable eye of prouidence, which was euer fixed vpon thy hands, thy tongue, thy heart? Couldſt thou thus hope to blinde the eies of a Seer? Heare then thy inditement, thy ſentence, from him, whom thou thoughteſt to haue mocked with thy conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Whence comst thou, Gehezi? Thy ſeruant went no whither.</hi> Hee that had begun a lye to <hi>Naaman,</hi> ends it to his maſter; who ſo lets his tongue once looſe to a wilfull vntruth, ſoone growes impudent in multiplying falſhoods. Of what
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:176654:240"/>metall is the forehead of that man, that dares lye to a Prophet? What is this but to out-face the ſenſes? <hi>Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned againe from his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret to meet thee?</hi> Didſt thou not till now know, O <hi>Gehezi,</hi> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets haue ſpirituall eyes, which are not confined to bodily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects?</p>
                     <p>Didſt thou not know that their hearts were often, where they were not? Didſt thou not know that thy ſecreteſt waies were ouer-loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by inuiſible witneſſes? Heare then, and be conuinced; Hither thou wenteſt, thus thou ſaidſt, thus thou didſt, thus thou ſped'ſt: What anſwer was now here but confuſion? Miſerable <hi>Gehezi,</hi> how didſt thou ſtand pale and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:176654:240"/>before the dreadfull Tribunall of thy ſeuere maſter, looking for the wofull ſentence of ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous iudgement for ſo hainous an offence? <hi>Is this a time to receiue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and to receiue garments, and</hi> (which thou hadſt already pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed in thy conceit) <hi>Oliueyards, and vineyards, and ſheepe, and oxen, and men-ſeruants, and maid-ſeruants?

The act ouertakes the word; <hi>Hee went out of his preſence, a leper as

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:176654:244"/>and frame his owne beame. No nice termes were ſtood vpon by theſe ſons of the Prophets; Their thoughts were fixed vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a ſpirituall building: As an homely roofe may ſerue them, ſo their owne hands ſhall raiſe it; The fingers of theſe contemplatiue men did not ſcorne the axe, and mallet, and cheſell: It was better being there, than in <hi>Obadiahs</hi> caue; &amp; they that dwell now contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder rude ſticks, will not refuſe the ſquared ſtones, and poliſhed contignations of better times. They ſhall be ill teachers of others, that haue not learned both to want, and to abound.</p>
                     <p>The maſter of this ſacred Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>Eliſha,</hi> is not ſtately, not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere; he giues not only paſſage to
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:176654:244"/>this motion of his Collegiates, but aſſiſtance: It was fit the ſonnes of the Prophets ſhould haue conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of dwelling, though not pompe, not coſtlineſſe. They fall to their worke; No man goes ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the building of his owne houſe: One of them, more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the tree than the toole, lets fall the head of his axe into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: Poore men are ſenſible of ſmall loſſes; Hee makes his mone to <hi>Eliſha; Alas maſter, for it was borrowed;</hi> Had the axe beene his owne, the trouble had beene the leſſe to forgoe it; therefore doth the miſcarriage afflict him, becauſe it was of a borrowed axe: Honeſt mindes are more carefull of what they haue by loane than by proprietie: In lending there is a
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:176654:245"/>truſt, which a good heart cannot diſappoint without vexation: Alas poore nouices of the Prophet, they would be building, and were not worth their axes; if they would giue their labour, they muſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>Their wealth was ſpirituall; Outward pouertie may well ſtand with inward riches; Hee is rich, not that hath the world, but that can contemne it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſha</hi> loues and cheriſhes this iuſt ſimplicitie; rather will hee worke a miracle, than a borrowed axe ſhall not be reſtored; It might eaſily be imagined, hee that could raiſe vp the iron out of the bottome of the water, could tell where it fell in; yet euen that powerfull hand cals for direction; In this one
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:176654:245"/>point, the ſonne of the Prophet knowes more than <hi>Eliſha;</hi> The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all particularities is neither fit for a creature, nor communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; A meane man may beſt know his owne caſe; this Nouice better knowes where his axe fell, than his maſter; his maſter knowes better how to get it out, than he. There is no reaſon to be giuen of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall actions: The Prophet borrowes an axe to cut an helue for the loſt axe; Why did he not make vſe of that handle which had caſt the head? Did he hold it vnworthy of reſpect, for that it had abandoned the metall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was truſted? Or did he make choice of a new ſticke, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle might be the more cleere, and vnqueſtionable? Diuine power
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:176654:246"/>goes a contrary way to Art; Wee firſt would haue procured the head of the axe, and then would haue fitted it with an helue; <hi>Eliſha</hi> fits the head to the helue; and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the wood, which was light, and knew not how to ſinke, to fetch vp the Iron, which was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and naturally vncapable of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatation. Whether the metall were ſtripped of the naturall weight, by the ſame power which gaue it being; or whether retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the wonted poiſe, it was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp by ſome ſpirituall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I inquire not; Onely, I ſee it ſwim, like Cork, vpon the ſtreame of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and moue towards the hand that loſt it: What creature is not willing to put off the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature, at the command of
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:176654:246"/>the God of Nature; Oh God, how eaſie is it for thee, when this hard and heauy heart of mine is ſunke downe into the mud of the world, to fetch it vp againe by thy mighty word, and cauſe it to float vpon the ſtreames of life, and to ſee the face of heauen againe?</p>
                     <p>Yet ſtill doe the ſides of <hi>Iſrael</hi> complaine of the thornes of <hi>Aram;</hi> The children of <hi>Ahab</hi> rue their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vniuſt mercy; From an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it is no making queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſtrength, or wile: The King of <hi>Syria</hi> conſults with his ſeruants, where to encampe for his greateſt aduantage; their opinion is not more required, than their ſecrecie; <hi>Eliſha</hi> is a thouſand Scouts; hee ſends word to the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the proiects, of the remoues of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:176654:247"/>his enemy: More than once hath <hi>Iehoram</hi> ſaued both his life, and his hoaſt, by theſe cloſe admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is well that in ſomething yet a Prophet may bee obeyed; What ſtrange State-ſeruice was this, which <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, beſides the ſpirituall? The King, the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> owe themſelues, and their ſafetie to a deſpiſed Prophet: The man of God knew, and felt them Idolaters; yet how carefull, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant is he, for their reſcue; If they were bad, yet they were his owne; If they were bad, yet not all; God had his number amongſt their worſt. If they were bad, yet the <hi>Syrians</hi> were worſe; The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> miſ-worſhipped the true God; the <hi>Syrians</hi> worſhipped a falſe; That (if it were poſſible) he might win
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:176654:247"/>them, he will preſerue them; and if they will needs bee wanting to God, yet <hi>Eliſha</hi> will not bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them; their impietie ſhall not make him vndutifull.</p>
                     <p>There cannot be a iuſter cauſe of diſpleaſure, than the diſcloſing of thoſe ſecret counſels, which are laid vp in our eare, in our breaſt. The King of <hi>Syria,</hi> not without reaſon, ſtomackes this ſuppoſed treacherie. What Prince can beare that an aduerſe power ſhould haue a partie, a Penſionarie in his owne Court? How famous was <hi>Eliſha,</hi> euen in forraine Regions? Beſides <hi>Naaman,</hi> others of the <hi>Syrian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie take notice of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous faculties of this Prophet of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> He is accuſed for this ſecret intelligence: No words can eſcape
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:176654:248"/>him, though ſpoken in the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber; O <hi>Syrian,</hi> whoſoeuer thou wert, thou ſaidſt not enough; If thy maſter doe but whiſper in thine eare, if he ſmother his words within his owne lips; if he do but ſpeake within his owne boſome, <hi>Eliſha</hi> knowes it from an infallible information; What counſell is it, O God, that can be hid from thee? What counſell is it, that thou wilt hide from thy Seer? Euen this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that accuſeth the Prophet is knowne to the accuſed; Hee heares this tale, whiles it is in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; he heares the plot for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion: How ill doe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of wicked men hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? They that confeſſe <hi>Eliſha</hi> knowes their ſecreteſt words, doe yet conferre to take him. There
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:176654:248"/>are Spies vpon him, whoſe eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als haue moued their anger, and admiration; He is deſcried to bee in <hi>Dothan,</hi> a ſmall Towne of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes;</hi> A whole Armie is ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſurpriſe him; The oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of the night is choſen for the exploit; There ſhall bee no want either in the number, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or ſecrecie of theſe conſpired troups: &amp; now when they haue ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly girt in the village with a ſtrong &amp; exquiſite ſiege, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſure of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> and pleaſe themſelues to think, how they haue incaged the miſerable Prophet, how they ſhould take him at vnawares in his bed, in the midſt of a ſecure dreame; how they ſhould carrie him fettered to their King; what thankes they ſhould haue for ſo welcome a priſoner.</p>

                     <p>The ſucceſſour of <hi>Gehezi</hi> riſeth early in the morning, and ſees all the Citie encompaſſed with a fearefull hoaſt of foot, horſe, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets: His eye could meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but woods of pikes, and walls of harneſſe, and luſtre of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; and now he runs in affrighted to his maſter; <hi>Alas, my master, what ſhall we doe?</hi> He had day enough to ſee they were enemies that inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned them; to ſee himſelfe help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and deſperate; and hath only ſo much life left in him, as to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelfe to the partner of his miſerie: He cannot flee from his new maſter, if he would; he runs to him, with a wofull clamour, <hi>Alas, my master, what ſhall we doe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh the vndaunted courage of faith! <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſees all this, and ſits
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:176654:249"/>in his chamber ſo ſecure, as if theſe had onely beene the guard of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> for his ſafe protection. It is an hard precept that he giues his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, <hi>Feare not;</hi> As well might hee haue bid him not to ſee, when he ſaw, as not to feare when hee ſaw ſo dreadfull a ſpectacle; The ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſenſes are not leſſe certaine, than thoſe of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where the obiects are no leſſe proper: But the taske is eaſie, if the next word may finde beleefe, <hi>[For there are moe with vs, than with them;]</hi> Multitude and other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward probabilities doe both leade the confidence of naturall hearts, and fix it: It is for none but a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> to ſay, <hi>I will not be afraid of ten thouſands of people, that haue ſet themſelues againſt mee round about:</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> man lookt about him; yet his maſter praies, <hi>Lord open his eyes that they may ſee;</hi> Naturally we ſee not, whiles we doe ſee; Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is ſo ſeene, as it is; Bodily eies diſcerne bodily obiects, onely ſpirituall can ſee the things of God; Some men want both eyes, and light; <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> ſeruant had eyes, wanted illumination; No ſooner were his eies open, than he ſaw the mountaine full of horſes, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets of fire round about <hi>Eliſha.</hi> They were there before, (neither doth <hi>Eliſha</hi> pray that thoſe troupes may be gathered, but that they may bee ſeene) not till now were
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:176654:250"/>they deſcried. Inuiſible Armies guard the ſeruants of God, whiles they ſeeme moſt forſaken of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aide, moſt expoſed to certaine dangers; If the eies of our Faith be as open as thoſe of our ſenſe, to ſee Angels as well as <hi>Syrians,</hi> wee cannot be appalled with the moſt vnequall termes of hoſtilitie; Thoſe bleſſed Spirits are ready ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſcue our bodies, or to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vp our ſoules to bleſſedneſſe; whether euer ſhall be inioyned of their Maker: there is iuſt comfort in both, in either.</p>
                     <p>Both thoſe charets that came to fetch <hi>Elijah,</hi> and thoſe that came to defend <hi>Eliſha,</hi> were fiery: God is not leſſe louely to his owne, in the midſt of his iudgements, than hee is terrible to his enemies, in
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:176654:251"/>the demonſtrations of his mercies. Thus guarded, it is no maruell if <hi>Eliſha</hi> dare walke forth into the midſt of the Syrians. Not one of thoſe heauenly Preſidiaries ſtrucke a ſtroke for the Prophet; neither doth he require their blowes; only he turnes his prayer to his God, and ſayes, <hi>Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindneſſe;</hi> With no other than deadly intentions did theſe Aramites come downe to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> yet doth not hee ſay, Smite them with the ſword, but, <hi>Smite them with blindneſſe;</hi> All the euill he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes to them, is their repentance; There was no way to ſee their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but by blindneſſe; Hee that prayed for the opening of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants eyes, to ſee his ſafe-gard; prayes for the blinding of the eyes
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:176654:251"/>of his enemies, that they might not ſee to doe hurt.</p>
                     <p>As the eyes of <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> ſeruant were ſo ſhut that they ſaw not the Angels, when they ſaw the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; ſo the eyes of the Syrians ſhall bee likewiſe ſhut, that when they ſee the man, they ſhall not ſee the Prophet: To all other obiects their eyes are cleare, only to <hi>Eliſha</hi> they ſhall be blinde; blinde, not through darkneſſe, but through miſ-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; they ſhall ſee, and miſtake both the perſon and the place: He that made the ſenſes, can either hold, or delude them at pleaſure; how eaſily can he offer to the ſight other repreſentations, than thoſe which ariſe from the viſible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and make the heart to beleeue them?</p>
                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:176654:252"/>
                     <p>Iuſtly now might <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſay, <hi>This is not the way, neither is this the Citie,</hi> wherein <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſhall be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He was in <hi>Dothan,</hi> but not as <hi>Eliſha;</hi> he ſhall not be found but in <hi>Samaria;</hi> neither can they haue any guide to him, but himſelfe. No ſooner are they come into the ſtreets of <hi>Samaria,</hi> than their eyes haue leaue to know both the place, and the Prophet: The firſt ſight they haue of themſelues, is in the trap of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the iawes of death; thoſe ſtately palaces, which they now wonder at vnwillingly, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie no reſemblance to them, but of their graues; Euerie Iſraelite ſeemes an executioner; euerie houſe a Iaile; euerie beame a gibbet; and now, they looke vpon <hi>Eliſha</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from their guide, to their
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:176654:252"/>common murderer, with horror and paleneſſe: It is moſt iuſt with God to intangle the plotters of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, in their owne ſnare.</p>
                     <p>How glad is a mortall enemy to ſnatch at all aduantages of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge? Neuer did the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> ſee a more pleaſing ſight, than ſo many <hi>Syrian</hi> throats at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and, as loth to loſe ſo faire a day, (as if his fingers itched to be dip't in bloud) he ſaies, <hi>My father, ſhall I ſmite, ſhall I ſmite them?</hi> The repetition argued deſire, the compellation, reuerence: Not without allowance of a Prophet, would the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lay his hand vpon an enemy, ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly trained home; His heart was ſtill foule with Idolatry, yet would he not taint his hand with forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:176654:253"/>bloud; Hypocriſie will be ſtill ſcrupulous in ſomething; and in ſome awfull reſtraints is a perfect counterfeit of conſcience.</p>
                     <p>The charitable Prophet ſoone giues an angry prohibition of ſlaughter; <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſmite them; Wouldst thou ſmite thoſe whom thou hast taken captiue, with thy ſword, and with thy bow?</hi> As if he ſaid, Theſe are Gods captiues, not thine; and if they were thine owne, their bloud could not bee ſhed without crueltie; though in the hot chaſes of warre, executions may be iuſtifiable; yet in the coole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of deliberation, it can be no other than inhumane, to take thoſe liues which haue beene yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to mercy; But here, thy bow and thy ſword are guiltleſſe of
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:176654:253"/>the ſucceſſe; onely a ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of the Almightie hath caſt them into thy hands, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy force, nor thy fraud could haue compaſſed; If it be victorie thou aymeſt at, ouercome them with kindneſſe; <hi>Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drinke;</hi> Oh noble reuenge of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to feaſt his perſecutors! To prouide a Table for thoſe, who had prouided a graue for him; Theſe <hi>Syrians</hi> came to <hi>Dothan</hi> full of bloudy purpoſes to <hi>Eliſha;</hi> hee ſends them from <hi>Samaria</hi> full of good cheare, and iollitie; Thus, thus ſhould a Prophet puniſh his purſuers; No vengeance but this is heroicall, and fit for Chriſtian imitation; <hi>If thine enemy hunger, giue him bread to eat; if he thirſt, giue
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:176654:254"/>him water to drinke: For thou ſhalt heape coales of fire vpon his head; and the Lord ſhall reward thee; Bee not ouercome with euill, but ouercome euill with good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath done that by his feaſt, which hee could not haue done by his ſword; The bands of <hi>Syria</hi> will no more come by way of ambuſh, or incurſion, into the bounds of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Neuer did a charitable act go away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the retribution of a bleſſing; In doing ſome good to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, wee doe moſt good to our ſelues: God cannot but loue in vs this imitation of his mercy, who bids his Sunne ſhine, and his raine fall where hee is moſt prouoked; and that loue is neuer fruitleſſe.</p>

<pb n="498" facs="tcp:176654:257"/>was iuſt, yet vnnaturall; This complainant had purchaſed one halfe of the liuing childe, by the one halfe of hers, dead; The mother of the furuiuing Infant is preſſed by couenant, by hunger; reſtrained by nature; To force a mother to deliuer vp her childe to voluntarie ſlaughter, had beene cruell; To force a Debtor to pay a confeſſed arerage, ſeemed but equall: If the remaining childe be not dreſſed for food, this mother of the deuoured childe is both robbed, and affamiſhed; If he bee, innocent bloud is ſhed by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                     <p>It is no maruell if the queſtion aſtoniſhed the Iudge; not ſo much for the difficultie of the demand, as the horror of the occaſion; To
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:176654:257"/>what lamentable diſtreſſe did <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam</hi> finde his people driuen? Not without cauſe did the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> rend his garments, and ſhew his ſack-cloth; well might he ſee his people branded with that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent curſe which God had denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the rebellious; <hi>The Lord ſhall bring a Nation againſt thee, of a fierce countenance, which ſhall not regard the perſon of the old, nor ſhew fauour to the young; And he ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege thee in all thy gates; And thou ſhalt eat the fruit of thine owne body, the fleſh of thy ſonnes, and of thy daughters; The tender and delicate woman, her eies ſhall be euill towards her young one that commeth out from betweene her feet, and towards the children which ſhe ſhall beare, for ſhe ſhall eat them for want of all things
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:176654:258"/>ſecretly in the ſiege and ſtraitneſſe.</hi> Hee mournes for the plague, hee mournes not for the cauſe of this plague, his ſin, and theirs; I finde his ſorrow, I finde not his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: The worſt man may grieue for his ſmart, onely the good heart grieues for his offence: In ſtead of being penitent, <hi>Iehoram</hi> is furious, and turnes his rage from his ſins, againſt the Prophet; <hi>God doe ſo to me, and more alſo, if the head of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, the ſonne of Shaphat, ſhall ſtand on him this day:</hi> Alas, what hath the righteous done? Perhaps <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> (that wee may imagine ſome colours of this diſpleaſure) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threatned this iudgement; but they deſerued it, perhaps he might haue auerted it by his prayers; their vnrepentance diſabled him;
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:176654:258"/>Perhaps hee perſwaded <hi>Iehoram</hi> to hold out the ſiege; though through much hardneſſe, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the deliuerance; In all this how hath <hi>Eliſha</hi> forfeited his head? All <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not afford an head ſo guiltleſſe as this that was deſtin'd to ſlaughter: This is the faſhion of the world; the lewd blames the innocent, and will reuenge their owne ſinnes vpon others vprightneſſe.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of all this ſad eſtate of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and theſe ſtormes of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> the Prophet ſits qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in his owne houſe, amongſt his holy Conſorts; bewailing no doubt both the ſinnes, and miſery of their people; and prophetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conferring of the iſſue; when ſuddenly God reueales to him the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:176654:259"/>bloudy intent, and meſſage of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam,</hi> and he at once reueales it to his fellowes. <hi>See yee how this ſonne of a murderer hath ſent to take away mine head.</hi> Oh the vnimitable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of a Prophet! The ſame God that ſhew'd him his danger, ſuggeſted his words; He may bee bold, where we muſt bee awfull; Still is <hi>Naboths</hi> bloud laid in <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams</hi> diſh; The foule fact of <hi>Ahab</hi> blemiſheth his poſteritie; and now when the ſonne threats violence to the innocent, murder is obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to him as hereditary.</p>
                     <p>He that foreſaw his owne perill, prouides for his ſafetie; <hi>[Shut the doore and hold him fast at the doore.]</hi> No man is bound to tender his throat to an vniuſt ſtroke; This bloudie commiſſion was preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:176654:259"/>by a propheticall fore-ſight: The ſame eye that ſaw the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner comming to ſmite him, ſaw alſo the King haſting after him, to ſtay the blow; The Prophet had beene no other than guiltie of his owne bloud, if he had not reſerued himſelfe a while, for the reſcue of authoritie: Oh the inconſtancie of carnall hearts! It was not long ſince <hi>Iehoram</hi> could ſay to <hi>Eliſha, My father, ſhall I ſmite them?</hi> now he is readie to ſmite him as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whom hee honoured as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Yet againe, his lips had no ſooner giuen ſentence of death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prophet, than his feet ſtirre to recall it; It ſhould ſeeme that <hi>Eliſha,</hi> vpon the challenges and expoſtulations of <hi>Iehorams</hi> meſſenger, had ſent a perſwaſiue
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:176654:260"/>meſſage to the King of Iſrael, yet a while to wait patiently vpon God for his deliuerance; The diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Prince flies off in an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent anger, <hi>Behold, this euill is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> Oh the deſperate reſolutions of impatient mindes! They haue ſtinted God both for his time and his meaſure; if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either, they either turne their backs vpon him, or flie in his face: The poſition was true, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence deadly: All that euill was of the Lord; they deſerued it, he ſent it: What then? It ſhould haue beene therefore argued, Hee that ſent it, can remoue it: I will wait vpon his mercie, vnder whoſe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice I ſuffer: Impatience and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt ſhal but aggrauate my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:176654:260"/>
                        <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what he will;</hi> But now to deſpaire becauſe God is iuſt, to defie mercy becauſe it lingers, to reiect God for correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is a preſumptuous madneſſe, an impious pettiſhneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Yet in ſpight of all theſe prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations both of King, and people, <hi>Eliſha</hi> hath good newes for <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram; Thus ſaith the Lord, To morrow about this time ſhall a meaſure of fine flowre bee ſold for a Shekell; and two meaſures of Barley for a Shekell in the gate of Samaria:</hi> Miſerable <hi>Iſrael</hi> now ſees an end of this hard triall; One daies patience ſhall free them both of ſiege, and famine. Gods deliuerances may ouer-ſtay our expectation, not the due period of his owne counſels. Oh infinite mercy, when man ſaies, <hi>No longer,</hi>
                        <pb n="506" facs="tcp:176654:261"/>God ſayes, <hi>To morrow;</hi> As if hee would condeſcend, where hee might iudge; and would pleaſe them who deſerued nothing but puniſhment. The word ſeemed not more comfortable, than incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; <hi>A Lord, on whoſe hand the King leaned, anſwered the man of God, and ſaid, Behold, if the Lord would make windowes in heauen, might this thing be?</hi> Propheſies, before they be fulfilled, are riddles; no ſpirit can areed them, but that by which they are deliuered. It is a fooliſh and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious infidelity to queſtion a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, where wee know the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is Gods: How eaſie is it for that omnipotent hand to effect thoſe things, which ſurpaſſe all the reach of humane conceit? Had God intended a miraculous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:176654:261"/>was it not as eaſie for him to increaſe the corne or meale of <hi>Samaria,</hi> as the widowes oyle? was it not as eaſie for him to giue plentie of victuals without ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the windowes of heauen, as to giue plentie of water without wind, or raine? The Almightie hates to be diſtruſted; This Peere of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall rue his vnbeleefe; <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eies, but ſhalt not eat thereof;</hi> The ſight ſhall bee yeelded for conuiction, the fruition ſhall be denied for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; Well is that man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to want the benefit which he would not beleeue; Who can pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſee Infidelitie excluded from the bleſſings of earth, from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of heauen?</p>
                     <p>How ſtrange a choice doth God
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:176654:262"/>make of the Intelligencers of ſo happy a change: Foure Lepers ſit at the entring of the Gate; they ſee nothing but death before them, famine within the walls, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, without: The election is wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; at laſt they reſolue vpon the leſſer euill; Famine is worſe than the <hi>Syrian;</hi> In the famine there is certaintie of periſhing; amongſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> hazzard; Perhaps the enemy may haue ſome pittie, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath none; and, were the death equally certaine, it were more eaſie to die by the ſword, than by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; vpon this deliberation they come downe into the <hi>Syrian</hi> camp, to finde either ſpeed of mercy, or diſpatch. Their hunger would not giue them reſpite till morning; By twi-light are they fallen vpon the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:176654:262"/>vttermoſt tents: <hi>Behold, there was no man;</hi> They maruell at the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſolitude; they looke, and liſten; the noiſe of their owne feet affrighted them; their guiltie hearts ſupplied the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected fearefully thoſe which were as fearefully fled: How eaſily can the Almightie confound the power of the ſtrong, the policie of the wiſe? God puts a Pannick ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into the hearts of the proud <hi>Syrians;</hi> hee makes them heare a noiſe of charets, and a noiſe of horſes, euen the noiſe of a great hoaſt; They ſay one to another, <hi>Loe the King of Iſrael hath hired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs the Kings of the Hittites, and the Kings of the Egyptians, to come vpon vs; they ariſe therefore in a confuſed rout, and leauing all their
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:176654:263"/>ſubstance behinde them, flee for their liues.</hi> Not long before, <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant ſaw charets and horſes, but heard none; Now, theſe <hi>Syrians</hi> heare charets and horſes, but ſee none; That ſight comforted his heart; this ſound diſmaied theirs; The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> heard no noiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walls, the Lepers heard no noiſe without the gates; Onely the <hi>Syrians</hi> heard this noiſe in their campe: What a ſcorne doth God put vpon theſe preſumptuous <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites?</hi> He will not vouchſafe to vſe any ſubſtantiall ſtratagem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; nothing but an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſound ſhall ſcatter them, and ſend them home emptie of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, laded with ſhame, halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dead with feare; the very horſes that might haue haſtned their flight, are
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:176654:263"/>left tied in their Tents; their verie garments are a burden; all is left behinde, ſaue their very bodies, and thoſe breathleſſe for ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſſe theſe <hi>Syrians</hi> knew well to what miſerable exigents the incloſed <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were brought, by their ſiege; and now made full account to ſacke, and ranſacke their <hi>Samaria;</hi> already had they diuided, and ſwallowed the prey; when ſuddenly God puts them into a ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and ſends them to ſeeke ſafetie in their heeles; no bootie is now in price with them but their life; and happy is he that can run faſteſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Almightie laughes at the deſignes of inſolent men, and ſhuts vp their counſels in ſhame.</p>
                     <pb n="512" facs="tcp:176654:264"/>
                     <p>The feare of the foure Lepers began now to giue way to ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; they fill their bellies, and hide their treaſures, and paſſe from one Tent to another, in a faſtidious choice of the beſt commodities; they who ere-while would haue held it happineſſe enough to haue beene bleſſed with a cruſt, now wantonly roue for dainties; and from neceſſitie leape into exceſſe.</p>
                     <p>How farre ſelfe-loue carries vs in all our actions; euen to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the publique? Not till their owne bellies, and hands, and eies were filled, did theſe Lepers thinke of imparting this newes to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> at laſt, when themſelues are glutted, they begin to remember the hunger of their brethren; and now they finde roome for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe;
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:176654:264"/>
                        <hi>We doe not well, this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace;</hi> Nature teaches vs that it is an iniurie to ingroſſe bleſſings: and ſo to minde the priuate, as if wee had no relation to a communitie; we are worthy to bee ſhut out of the Citie-gates for Lepers, if the reſpects to the publique good doe not ouer-ſway with vs in all our deſires, in all our demeanure; and well may we with theſe couetous Lepers feare a miſchiefe vpon our ſelues, if wee ſhall wilfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale bleſſings from others.</p>
                     <p>The conſcience of this wrong and danger ſends backe the Lepers into the Citie; they call to the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and ſoone tranſmit the newes to the Kings houſhold; The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> complaines not to haue
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:176654:265"/>his ſleepe broken with ſuch intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; He ariſeth in the night, and not contemning good newes, though brought by Lepers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults with his ſeruants of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>We cannot be too iealous of the intentions of an enemy; <hi>Iehoram</hi> wiſely ſuſpects this flight of the <hi>Syrians</hi> to be but ſimulatorie, and politicke; onely to draw <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of their Citie, for the ſpoile of both; There may be more perill in the backe of an enemy, than in the face; the cruelleſt ſlaughters haue beene in retiring: Eaſily therefore is the King perſwaded to aduenture ſome few for-lorne Scouts for further aſſurance; The word of <hi>Eliſha</hi> is out of his head, out of his heart; elſe there had bin
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:176654:265"/>no place for this doubt: Timorous hearts neuer thinke themſelues ſure; thoſe that haue no ſaith, had need of much ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe few horſes that remaine, are ſent forth for diſcouery; they finde nothing but Monuments of frightfulneſſe, pledges of ſecuritie: Now <hi>Iſrael</hi> dares iſſue forth to the prey; There (as if the <hi>Syrians</hi> had comne thither to inrich them) they finde granaries, wardrobes, treaſures, and what euer may ſerue either for vſe, or oſtentation: Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Iſraelite</hi> goes away filled, laden, wearied with the wealthy ſpoile.</p>
                     <p>As ſcarcitie breeds dearth, ſo plentie cheapneſſe: To day a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of fine flower is lower rated, than yeſterday of dung.</p>
                     <p>The diſtruſtfull Peere of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                        <pb n="516" facs="tcp:176654:266"/>ſees this abundance, according to the word of the Prophet, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes it not: he ſees this plentie can come in at the gate, though the windowes of heauen be not open; The gate is his charge; The affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed <hi>Iſraelites</hi> preſſe in vpon him, and beare him downe in the throng; Extreme hunger hath no reſpect to greatneſſe: Not their rudeneſſe, but his owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe hath trampled him vnder feet.
